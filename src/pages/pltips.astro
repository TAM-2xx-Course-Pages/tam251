<SubSection title="Inputting answers" id="inputs">
<ul>

    <li><strong>No Fractions:</strong> Do not use fractions as your input answer. Instead use
        decimal numbers (e.g. <font face="courier new">2/3</font> is not accepted as a correct
        answer, however <font face="courier new">0.667</font> is).</li>
    <li><strong>Error tolerance is 1%:</strong> Your answer must be accurate to within a
        relative tolerance of 0.01.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>For example, you may (correctly) compute a strain value of <font
                        face="courier new">x = 1.17*10^(-3)</font> using symbolic expressions.
                    If you enter your answer as <font face="courier new">x = 0.0012</font> 
                    (exactly five digits, and two
                    significant digits), PrairieLearn will mark the answer <font
                        face="courier new">0.0012</font> incorrect, as the difference between
                    these two values is about 2.5% (that is, <font face="courier new">
                        (1.2-1.17)/1.17 = 0.0256)</font> and exceeds PL&#39;s tolerance for
                    correct answers.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Parenthesis: </strong>You should be obsessive about making sure your equations
        are typed correctly.
        <ul>
            <li> Example: <em>Powers -</em> the entire base is wrapped in parenthesis as well as
                the power (i.e. <font face="courier new">3*2^1/3</font> vs. <font
                    face="courier new">(3*2)^(1/3)</font>).</li>
            <li>Example: <em>Division -</em> the numerator and denominator are both individually
                wrapped in parenthesis (i.e. <font face="courier new">1/2*3</font> vs. <font
                    face="courier new">1/(2*3)</font>).</li>
            <li>Your code should look like you don't trust the built-in order of operations.
                <em>Be obsessive</em>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Units: </strong>It is your responsibility to check the units in your problem.
        <ul>
            <li>You should know the base units (i.e. <InlineEquation equation="\\rm\\ MPa = \\frac{\\rm N}{\\rm mm^2}" />
                , <InlineEquation equation="\\rm\\  ksi = \\frac{\\rm kips}{\\rm in^2}" />
                , etc.) and how to convert given units (i.e.
                <InlineEquation equation=" \\rm\\ MPa = 10^6 \\ Pa, 12 \\ \\text{in} = 1 \\ \\text{ft}" />
                , etc.). This is another
                thing that you should be very careful about. When doing a problem, it is good to
                write out the units as a separate equation to make sure that it makes sense. For
                example:
                <DisplayEquation equation="  \\begin{align}  \\delta &= \\frac{FL}{EA} \\\\  [\\rm mm] &= \\frac{[\\rm kN][\\rm mm]}{[\\rm MPa][\\rm mm^2]} \\\\  [\\rm mm] &= \\frac{[\\rm kN][\\rm mm]}{[\\frac{\\rm N}{\\rm mm^2}][\\rm mm^2]} =  \\frac{[10^3 \\rm N][\\rm mm^3]}{[\\rm N][\\rm mm^2]} \\\\  \\therefore [\\rm mm] &= [\\rm mm]  \\end{align}  " />

                <em>Note:</em> The \(10^3\) conversion would need to be applied to the force for
                the final equation to be true.
            </li>
            <li>If everything is given in \(\rm\ N\) and \(\rm\ m\), but the answers ask for \(\rm\ kN\) and \(\rm\ mm\), then it is your responsibility to convert the answer. <em>Be
                    obsessive</em> about checking these things before submitting your answer.
            </li>
        </ul>

<SubSection title="Reviewing for CBTF Quizzes" id="quizzes">
    <p>Review for quizzes with the relevant homework assignment. The course website tells you which
        homeworks are relevant and explicitly states the topics covered in each quiz. The quiz
        problems are similar to those found on the homework.</p>

    <p>Doing the homework, it’s important to make sure that you fully understand as completely as
        possible the solution you reach for each question. When reviewing your homework problems,
        you should make sure that you can do the problem on paper, type it into your calculator of
        choice, and get the correct answer on the first try.
        It’s easy to overlook some key concepts in the course by “brute forcing” signs and units in
        the homework (see above). If you find you are consistently getting answers off by factors of
        10, or making a sign error, it can be easy to correct and overlook while doing the homework,
        but be very costly during the quiz.</p>

    <p>If you are arriving at the correct answer on your first try for each of the homework
        questions, then the next step would be to consider potential modifications to the questions.
        How would the procedure for solving the problem change if you were given different
        information? What information was absolutely necessary to solve the problem? Do you
        understand why you were able to make all of the assumptions you did?</p>

    <p>Using a Python script is strongly recommended as is can help you keep track of your work.</p>

            judgement.</li>

        <li>Degrees vs. Radians: Make sure that you know how the computational tool you are using
            calculates cos and sin. If you want to check this, you can calculate a quantity like
            <strong>
                \(\cos(90)\)
            </strong> which should equal <strong>
