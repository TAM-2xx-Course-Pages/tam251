For \\( \\sigma \\le \\sigma_{pl} \\), the diagram is linear, and the behavior is elastic. For \\( \\sigma_{pl} < \\sigma < \\sigma_Y \\), the diagram is nonlinear, but the behavior is still elastic.

Plastic Behavior Stresses above the plastic limit (\\( \\sigma_Y < \\sigma \\)) cause the material to permanently deform. Yield Strength Perfect plastic or ideal plastic: well-defined \\( \\sigma_Y \\), stress plateau up to failure. Some materials (e.g. mild steel) have two yield points (stress plateau at \\( \\sigma_{YL} \\)). Most ductile metals do not have a stress plateau; yield strength \\( \\sigma_{YS} \\) is then defined by the 0.002 (0.2\\%) offset method. Strain Hardening Strain hardening Atoms rearrange in plastic region of ductile materials when a higher stress is sustained. Plastic strain remains after unloading as permanent set, resulting in permanent deformation. Reloading is linear elastic up to the new, higher yield stress (at A') and a reduced ductility. Ultimate Strength The ultimate strength (\\( \\sigma_u \\)) is the maximum stress the material can withstand. Necking Necking After ultimate stress (\\( \\sigma_u < \\sigma \\)), the middle of the material elongates before failure. Failure Also called fracture or rupture stress (\\( \\sigma_f \\)) is the stress at the point of failure for the material. Brittle and Ductile materials fail differently. Ductile materials generally fail in shear. There is a large region of plastic deformation before failure (fracture) at higher strain and necking. Ductile failure Axial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum shear stress at \\(45^o\\) angle Torsion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum shear stress at \\(0^o\\) angle Brittle materials are weaker in tension than shear.

Brittle failure Axial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum normal stress at \\(0^o\\) angle Torsion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum normal stress at \\(45^o\\) angle Note the difference between engineering and true stress/strain diagrams: ultimate stress is a consequence of necking, and the true maximum is the true fracture stress. Example: Concrete is a brittle material. Maximum compressive strength is substantially larger than the maximum tensile strength. For this reason, concrete is almost always reinforced with steel bars or rods whenever it is designed to support tensile loads. Heads up! Strain Energy builds on this content in Engineering Materals. Deformation does work on the material: equal to internal strain energy (by energy conservation). $$ \\Delta U = \\int F_{z}dz = \\int \\sigma_{z}(\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z)d\\varepsilon_{z}\\ $$ Energy density. $$ u = \\frac{\\Delta U}{\\Delta V} = \\int \\sigma_{z}d\\varepsilon_{z}\\ $$ Can be generalized to any deformation: areas under stress-strain curves $$ u = \\int \\sigma d\\varepsilon \\quad \\text{or} \\quad u = \\int \\tau d\\gamma\\ $$ Heads up! Fatigue builds on this content in Engineering Materals and Mechanical Design. SN curve examples If stress does not exceed the elastic limit, the specimen returns to its original configuration. However, this is not the case if the loading is repeated thousands or millions of times. In such cases, rupture will happen at stress lower than the fracture stress - this phenomenon is known as fatigue.

    "text": "Vectors A vector is an arrow with a length and a direction. Just like positions, vectors exist before we measure or describe them. Unlike positions, vectors can mean many different things, such as position vectors, velocities, etc. Vectors are not anchored to particular positions in space, so we can slide a vector around and locate it at any position. animatereset Change: lengthdirection Two vectors, which may or may not be the same vector. Moving a vector around does not change it: it is still the same vector. Notation Some textbooks differentiate between free vectors, which are free to slide around, and bound vectors, which are anchored in space. We will only use free vectors. We will use the over-arrow notation \\( \\vec{a} \\) for vector quantities. Other common notations include bold \\( \\boldsymbol{a} \\) and under-bars \\( \\underline{a} \\). For unit (length one) vectors we will use an over-hat \\( \\hat{a} \\). Cartesian coordinate system Cartesian coordinates (also known as rectangular coordinates) are the regular \\(x,y\\) or \\(x,y,z\\) coordinates in 2D and 3D, with perpendicular straight-line axes. coordinatenamerangedefinition\\(x\\)horizontal\\(-\\infty \\lt x \\lt \\infty\\)horizontal distance from the \\(y\\)-axis\\(y\\)vertical\\(-\\infty \\lt y \\lt \\infty\\)vertical distance from the \\(x\\)-axis In 3D the \\(x\\),\\(y\\),\\(z\\) axes are oriented in right-handed order, so that fingers curling from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) means the thumb points in the \\(z\\) direction. Cartesian coordinate system, showing the origin \\(O\\) and three positions with their coordinates. Notation note When writing coordinates we can either list the coordinate values explicitly, like \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 1\\), or we can just write the numbers in an ordered list, like \\( (2, 1) \\). Writing them as a list assumes that we know which coordinate system we are using, and which order the coordinates are in. We will typically write the coordinate values explicitly to avoid confusion. This also applies to vector components. Did you know? While the idea of \\(x,y\\) coordinates specifying positions might seem obvious, the use of algebraic quantities to define geometry in this way was a major discovery of Ren\u00c3\u00a9 Descartes and a key event in the scientific revolution. Descartes was also instrumental in establishing the philosophical groundwork of The Enlightenment, and we owe to him the famous phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cCogito ergo sum\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Polar coordinate system Polar coordinates are an alternative 2D coordinate system that are useful for rotating or circular motion. coordinatenamerangedefinition\\(r\\)radius\\(0 \\le r \\lt \\infty\\)distance from the origin \\(O\\)\\(\\theta\\)angle\\(-\\pi \\lt \\theta \\le \\pi\\)angle from the \\(x\\)-axis in the \\(x\\)\u00e2\u0080\u0093\\(y\\) plane The two common extensions of polar coordinates to 3D are cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates. Polar coordinate system, showing the origin \\(O\\) and three positions with their coordinates. To define polar coordinates, we relate them to another known coordinate system, typically Cartesian coordinates as follows, where we use the atan2 function. Conversion between polar and Cartesian coordinates #rvp-ep $$ \\begin{aligned}x &= r \\cos\\theta& r &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\\\y &= r \\sin\\theta& \\theta &= \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)\\end{aligned} $$ Did you know? Angles can be measured in many different units. While radians are the most mathematically elegant unit, their use dates only from Roger Cotes in the 18th century. Degrees are a much older unit, dating back to the sexagesimal number system of the ancient Babylonians, and are convenient for celestial calculations because there are approximately 360 days in one year. Other units include grads (100 grads in a right angle) and mils (various definitions, all approximately equal to a milliradian). Notation note When solving for \\(\\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we know that \\(\\tan\\theta = y / x\\). However, this does not necessary mean that \\( \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(y / x) \\), because \\(\\tan\\) is not a one-to-one function. For example, \\( \\tan^{-1}(1/1) \\) is the same as \\( \\tan^{-1}(-1/-1) \\). We thus need to take \\( \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(y/x) + pi \\) if the point is in quadrants II or III. An alternative is to use the atan2 function, which takes \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as separate arguments and correctly handles the conversion to \\(\\theta\\) in any quadrant. This function is available in all common programming languages, including C, MATLAB, Python, and others. Scientific calculators typically have special commands to convert to/from polar and Cartesian coordinates, which also automatically correctly handle the different quadrants. Units When using coordinates to describe the location of physical positions in the real world, we must always have appropriate units of length for the coordinates. For example, the following coordinates all specify the same position: $$ \\begin{aligned} x &= 2{\\rm\\ m} & x &= 6.56{\\rm\\ ft} & r &= 6.32{\\rm\\ m} & r &= 249{\\rm\\ in} \\\\ y &= -6{\\rm\\ m} & y &= -6 \\times 10^6{\\rm\\ \\mu m} & \\theta &= 1.25{\\rm\\ rad} & \\theta &= 71.6^\\circ. \\end{aligned} $$ It is important to distinguish between units and dimensions. The base dimensions include mass (M), length (L), and time (T), and can be combined to produce dimensions such as L/T or L\u00c2\u00a0T\\( ^{-1} \\) for velocity. Each physical quantity such as velocity has just one set of dimensions, and there is no choice in this. Units are particular ways of measuring dimensional quantities, and include the SI units kilogram (kg), meter (m), and second (s), as well as the customary U.S. units pound (lb) and foot (ft). A given physical quantity can be written in terms of many different units, although all of these must conform to the dimensions of the quantity. For example, velocity has dimension L/T and so it can be written in terms of the units m/s, ft/s, km/h, or many other choices. Angles are an example of a dimensionless quantity (having dimension 1), but they still have units, typically either radians (rad) or degrees (\u00c2\u00b0). Did you know? The SI unit system is the definitive system of measurement used in science and engineering. Other systems, such as U.S. customary units are defined in terms of SI units, so that an inch is defined to be exactly 2.54\u00c2\u00a0cm, for example. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains an excellent reference guide to SI units, including precise rules and style conventions for writing units in scientific and engineering work. Unit vectors A unit vector is any vector with a length of one. We use the special over-hat notation \\( \\hat{a} \\) to indicate when a vector is a unit vector. Any non-zero vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) gives a unit vector \\( \\hat{a} \\) that specifies the direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\). Normalization to unit vector. #rvv-eu $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{a} =\\frac{\\vec{a}}{a}\\end{aligned} $$  If we compute the length of \\( \\hat{a} \\) then we find: $$ \\| \\hat{a} \\| = \\left\\| \\frac{\\vec{a}}{a} \\right\\| = \\frac{\\|\\vec{a}\\|}{a} = \\frac{a}{a} = 1, $$ so \\( \\hat{a} \\) is really a unit vector, and it is in the same direction as \\( \\vec{a} \\) as they differ only by a scalar factor. Any vector can be written as the product of its length and direction: Vector decomposition into length and direction. #rvv-ei $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = a\\hat{a}\\end{aligned} $$  This follows from rearranging #rvv-eu. Three vectors and their decompositions into lengths and directional unit vectors. Vectors bases To describe vectors mathematically, we write them as a combination of basis vectors. An orthonormal basis is a set of two (in 2D) or three (in 3D) basis vectors which are orthogonal (have 90\u00c2\u00b0 angles between them) and normal (have length equal to one). We will not be using non-orthogonal or non-normal bases. Any other vector can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors: Components of a vector. #rvv-ec $$ \\vec{a} = a_1 \\,\\hat{\\imath}+ a_2 \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + a_3 \\,\\hat{k} $$ The numbers \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\) are called the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) in the \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\hat{\\jmath}, \\hat{k} \\) basis. If we are in 2D then we will only have two components for a vector. Writing a vector as the sum of scaled basis vectors. The scale factors are the components of the vector. Here \\( \\vec{a} = 3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath \\), so the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) are \\(a_1 = 3\\) and \\(a_2 = 2\\). We draw the symbol \\(\\odot\\) (arrow tip) to indicate a vector coming out of the page, and \\(\\otimes\\) (arrow fletching) to indicate an arrow going into the page. Two standard arrangements of the basis vectors when working in 2D. Either \\(\\hat\\jmath\\) is the vertical and \\( \\hat{k} \\) is out of the page, or \\( \\hat{k} \\) is the vertical and \\(\\hat\\jmath\\) is into the page. In both cases \\(\\hat\\imath\\) is horizontal. Notation note Just as for position coordinates, we can write the vector components \\(3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath\\) as the ordered list \\((3, 2)\\) if we know which basis we are using. Because we often will be using several bases simultaneously, we will generally write the components explicitly in the \\(3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath\\) form. Did you know? The use of the letter \\(i,j,k\\) for basis vectors is due to William Hamilton, who was motivated by thinking of basis vectors as extensions of the complex number \\(i\\). This notation was popularized by the book Vector Analysis: A Text Book for the Use of Students of Mathematics and Physics Founded upon the Lectures of J. Willard Gibbs (1901), by E. B. Wilson. This book also introduced the use of bold letters to represent vectors. Length of vectors The length of a vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is written either \\( \\| \\vec{a} \\| \\) or just plain \\(a\\). The length can be computed using Pythagorus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 theorem: Pythagorus' length formula. #rvv-ey $$ a = \\|\\vec{a}\\| = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2} $$  First we prove Pythagorus' theorem for right-angle triangles. For side lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\), the fact that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) can be seen graphically below, where the gray area is the same before and after the triangles are rotated in the animation: animatereset Pythagorus' theorem immediately gives us vector lengths in 2D. To find the length of a vector in 3D we can use Pythagorus' theorem twice, as shown below. This gives the two right-triangle calculations: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ell^2 &= a_1^2 + a_2^2 \\\\ a^2 &= \\ell^2 + a_3^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Click and drag to rotate. + Warning: Length must be computed in a single basis. #rvv-wl The Pythagorean length formula can only be used if all the components are written in a single orthonormal basis. Computing the length of a vector using Pythagorus' theorem. Some common integer vector lengths are \\( \\vec{a} = 4\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(a = 5\\)) and \\( \\vec{b} = 12\\hat\\imath + 5\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(b = 13\\)). + Warning: Adding vectors does not add lengths. #rvv-wa If \\( \\vec{c} = \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\), then \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\ne \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\) unless \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) are parallel and in the same direction. It will always be true, however, that \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\le \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\). This fact is known as the triangle inequality, for reasons that should be obvious. Did you know? Sets of three integers \\(a,b,c\\) where \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) are called Pythagorean triples. A long list of such triples is given on the Plimpton 322 clay tablet written by the ancient Babylonians around 1800\u00c2\u00a0BCE, although it is unclear how they generated these numbers. Pythagorean triples lead to complex mathematics, including the curious patterns shown below and Fermat's Last Theorem. The values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for all Pythagorean triples \\(a,b,c\\) with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) up to 2000. Changing bases To change the basis that a vector is written in, we need to know how the basis vectors are related. We do this by writing one set of basis vectors in terms of the other basis vectors. If we want to change from \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) to \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v} \\), then we need to write \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) in terms of \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v} \\) and then substitute the expressions. + Example: Example: Basis change. #rvv-xn For example, if we have \\( \\vec{a} = 3\\,\\hat{\\imath} + 2\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\) and we want to write this in the \\( \\,hat{u}, ,hat{v} \\) basis, then we need to know \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\) in terms of \\( \\,\\hat{u}, \\,\\hat{v} \\). From above we see that: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\imath} &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{u} - \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{v} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v} \\\\ \\hat{\\jmath} &= \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{u} + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{v} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}.\\end{aligned} $$ Then we can substitute and re-arrange: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= 3\\,\\hat{\\imath} + 2\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= 3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}\\right) \\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\,\\hat{u} + \\left(-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\,\\hat{v} \\\\ &= \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}.\\end{aligned} $$ If we want to convert back the other way then we would need to know \\( \\,\\hat{u}, \\,\\hat{v} \\) in terms of \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\). We can find this by solving for \\( \\,\\hat{u}, \\,\\hat{v} \\) above, giving: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{u} &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\imath + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\hat{v} &= -\\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\imath + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\jmath.\\end{aligned} $$ We can also write the general expressions for basis change, as below. Change of basis formulas. #rvv-eg $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} &=a_i \\, \\hat\\imath + a_j \\, \\hat\\jmath + a_k \\, \\hat{k}& \\vec{a} &=a_u \\, \\hat{u} + a_v \\, \\hat{v} + a_w \\, \\hat{w} \\\\[1em]a_i &= a_u u_i + a_v v_i + a_w w_i& a_u &= a_i i_u + a_j j_u + a_k k_u \\\\a_j &= a_u u_j + a_v v_j + a_w w_j& a_v &= a_i i_v + a_j j_v + a_k k_v \\\\a_k &= a_u u_k + a_v v_k + a_w w_k& a_w &= a_i i_w + a_j j_w + a_k k_w\\end{aligned} $$  We will derive the first set of equations (the second set are derived similarly). The vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) can be written in both the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath,\\hat{k} \\) and \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v},\\hat{w} \\) bases: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= a_i \\hat\\imath + a_j \\hat\\jmath + a_k \\hat{k} & \\vec{a} &= a_u \\hat{u} + a_v \\hat{v} + a_w \\hat{w}. \\end{aligned} $$ We can write each \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v},\\hat{w} \\) basis vector in terms of the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath,\\hat{k} \\) basis: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{u} &= u_i \\hat\\imath + u_j \\hat\\jmath + u_k \\hat{k} \\\\ \\hat{v} &= v_i \\hat\\imath + v_j \\hat\\jmath + v_k \\hat{k} \\\\ \\hat{w} &= w_i \\hat\\imath + w_j \\hat\\jmath + w_k \\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting these expressions into \\( \\vec{a} \\) gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= a_u \\hat{u} + a_v \\hat{v} + a_w \\hat{w} \\\\ &= a_u (u_i \\hat\\imath + u_j \\hat\\jmath + u_k \\hat{k}) + a_v (v_i \\hat\\imath + v_j \\hat\\jmath + v_k \\hat{k}) + a_w (w_i \\hat\\imath + w_j \\hat\\jmath + w_k \\hat{k}) \\\\ &= (a_u u_i + a_v v_i + a_w w_i) \\hat\\imath + (a_u u_j + a_v v_j + a_w w_j) \\hat\\jmath + (a_u u_k + a_v v_k + a_w w_k) \\hat{k} \\\\ &= a_i \\hat\\imath + a_j \\hat\\jmath + a_k \\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ Comparing the last two lines gives the component formulas. In 2D the change between two orthonormal bases is a rotation by an angle \\( \\theta \\), resulting in the change of basis expression below. Change of basis formula in 2D. #rvv-e2 $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= a_i \\, \\hat\\imath + a_j \\, \\hat\\jmath & \\vec{a} &= a_u \\, \\hat{u} + a_v \\, \\hat{v} \\\\[1em] a_i &= \\cos\\theta \\, a_u - \\sin\\theta \\, a_v & a_u &= \\cos\\theta \\, a_i + \\sin\\theta \\, a_j \\\\ a_j &= \\sin\\theta \\, a_u + \\cos\\theta \\, a_v & a_v &= -\\sin\\theta \\, a_i + \\cos\\theta \\, a_j \\end{aligned} $$  Elementary geometry gives the relationships between the basis vectors: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat\\imath &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{u} - \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{v} & \\hat{u} &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\hat\\jmath &= \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{u} + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{v} & \\hat{v} &= -\\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath. \\end{aligned} $$ Thus we have the components: $$ \\begin{aligned} i_u &= \\cos\\theta & i_v &= -\\sin\\theta & u_i &= \\cos\\theta & u_j &= \\sin\\theta \\\\ j_u &= \\sin\\theta & j_v &= \\cos\\theta & v_i &= -\\sin\\theta & v_j &= \\cos\\theta. \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting these into #rvv-eg and ignoring the third components gives the desired expressions. Vector expressions are true no matter which basis we write the vectors in, even if they are written in different bases. + Example: Vector addition in different bases. #rvv-xa Adding \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) to get the result \\( \\vec{c} \\) is a well-defined operation even before any basis is used, so it cannot depend on the basis chosen. As we see below, we can do the calculation in either the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) or \\( \\hat{u}, \\hat{v} \\) basis. Show components: none \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\)\\( \\hat{u}, \\hat{v} \\) mixed $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{c} &= \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\\\ &= (3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath) + (3\\hat\\imath - \\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= 6\\hat\\imath + \\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\vec{c} &= \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\\\ &= (3.5\\hat{u} - 0.7\\hat{v}) + (1.4\\hat{u} - 2.8\\hat{v}) \\\\ &= 4.9\\hat{u} - 3.5\\hat{v} \\\\ \\vec{c} &= \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\\\ &= (3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath) + (1.4\\hat{u} - 2.8\\hat{v}) \\\\ &= 3\\hat\\imath - 2.8\\hat{v} + 2\\hat\\jmath + 1.4\\hat{u}. \\end{aligned} $$ The component order in the mixed expression is arbitrary. + Example Problem: Cross product in different bases. #rvv-xx Consider the two vectors shown below and their components in two bases, together with their lengths: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= 3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath = 3.5\\hat{u} - 0.7\\hat{v} & a &= \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = 3.6 \\\\ \\vec{b} &= 3\\hat\\imath - \\hat\\jmath = 1.4\\hat{u} - 2.8\\hat{v} & b &= \\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = 3.2 \\end{aligned} $$ Show components: none \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\)\\( \\hat{u}, \\hat{v} \\) Compute the cross product \\( \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\) using: (1) the angle formula #rvv-el; (2) the component formula #rvv-ex with \\( \\vec{a}, \\vec{b} \\) both in the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) basis, both in the \\( \\hat{u}, \\hat{v} \\) basis, and with \\( \\vec{a} \\) in the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) basis and \\( \\vec{b} \\) in the \\( \\hat{u}, \\hat{v} \\) basis.  (1) The dot product is \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 7 \\) and the vector lengths are \\(a = 3.6\\) and \\(b = 3.2\\), so \\(\\cos\\theta = 7 / (ab)\\) and \\(\\theta \\approx 53^\\circ\\). Now using #rvv-el gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} &= a b \\sin\\theta ( -\\hat{k}) \\\\ &\\approx -9 \\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ (2) Using the component formula #rvv-ex gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} (3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath) \\times (3\\hat\\imath - \\hat\\jmath) &= -3 \\hat\\imath \\times \\hat\\jmath + 6 \\hat\\jmath \\times \\hat\\imath \\\\ &= -3 \\hat{k} - 6 \\hat{k} \\\\ &= -9 \\hat{k} \\\\ (3.5 \\hat{u} - 0.7 \\hat{v}) \\times (1.4 \\hat{u} - 2.8 \\hat{v}) &= - (3.5 \\times 2.8) \\hat{u} \\times \\hat{v} - (0.7 \\times 1.4) \\hat{v} \\times \\hat{u} \\\\ &= -10 \\hat{k} + \\hat{k} \\\\ &= -9 \\hat{k} \\\\ (3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath) \\times (1.4\\hat{u} - 2.8\\hat{v}) &= (3 \\times 1.4) \\hat\\imath \\times \\hat{u} - (3 \\times 2.8) \\hat\\imath \\times \\hat{v} \\\\ &\\quad + (2 \\times 1.4) \\hat\\jmath \\times \\hat{u} - (2 \\times 2.8) \\hat\\jmath \\times \\hat{v} \\\\ &= 4.2 \\sin 53^\\circ \\, \\hat{k} - 8.5 \\sin 143^\\circ \\, \\hat{k} \\\\ &\\quad - 2.8 \\sin 53^\\circ \\, \\hat{k} - 5.7 \\sin 53^\\circ \\, \\hat{k} \\\\ &= - 9 \\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ + Example: Dot product is independent of basis. #rvv-xd Equation #rvv-ed makes it clear that the dot product does not depend on which basis we use to write \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), so long as we use the same orthonormal basis for both of them. This is because the dot product only depends on the lengths and angle between the vectors, which are real physical quantities that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change just because we use a different basis. However, we can also verify directly that the component equation #rvv-es for the dot product does not depend on which basis we use. To keep the algebra short, we will only do this in 2D. We compute the dot product using #rvv-es in the $\\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath$ basis and substitute in the change-of-basis expressions #rvv-eg, giving: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} &= a_i b_i + a_j b_j \\\\ &= (u_i a_u + v_i a_v ) (u_i b_u + v_i b_v) + (u_j a_u + v_j a_v) (u_j b_u + v_j b_v) \\\\ &= (u_i^2 + u_j^2) a_u b_u + (v_i^2 + v_j^2) a_v b_v + (u_i v_i + u_j b_j) (a_u b_v + a_v b_u) \\\\ &= \\| \\hat{u} \\|^2 a_u b_u + \\| \\hat{v} \\|^2 a_v b_v + (\\hat{u} \\cdot \\hat{v}) (a_u b_v + a_v b_u) \\\\ &= a_u b_u + a_v b_v. \\end{aligned} $$ To get the last line we used the fact that \\( \\hat{u} \\) and \\( \\hat{v} \\) form an orthornormal basis, so that they each have length 1 (that is, \\( \\|\\hat{u}\\| = \\|\\hat{v}\\| = 1 \\)) and they are orthogonal (that is, \\( \\hat{u} \\cdot \\hat{v} = 0 \\) ). This then shows that $$ \\begin{aligned} a_i b_i + a_j b_j &= a_u b_u + a_v b_v \\end{aligned} $$ and so it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter which basis we use to compute \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\) , so long as we use an orthonormal basis. Projection and complementary projection The projection and complementary projection are: Projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) onto \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-ep $$ \\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})= (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}= (a \\cos\\theta) \\, \\hat{b} $$ Complementary projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) with respect to \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-em $$ \\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b})&= \\vec{a} -\\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) =\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b} \\\\\\left\\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\right\\|&= a \\sin\\theta\\end{aligned} $$ Adding the projection and the complementary projection of a vector just give the same vector again, as we can see on the figure below. Projection of \\( \\vec{a} \\) onto \\( \\vec{b} \\) and the complementary projection. As we see in the diagram above, the complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference vector: Complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference. #rvv-er $$ \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 $$  Using the definitions of the complementary projection rvv-em and projection rvv-ep, we compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} &= \\Big(\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}\\Big) \\cdot \\vec{b} \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) (\\hat{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}) \\\\ &= a b \\cos\\theta - (a\\cos\\theta) b \\\\ &= 0. \\end{aligned} $$ Change in length and direction Two useful derivatives are the rates of change of a vector's length and direction: Derivative of vector length. #rvc-el $$ \\dot{a} = \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a} $$  We start with the dot product expression #rvv-ed for length and differentiate it: $$ \\begin{aligned} a &= \\sqrt{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a}} \\\\ \\frac{d}{dt} a &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\big( (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a})^{1/2} \\big) \\\\ \\dot{a} &= \\frac{1}{2} (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a})^{-1/2} (\\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{a} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\dot{\\vec{a}}) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{a^2}} (2 \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{a}) \\\\ &= \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a}.\\end{aligned} $$ Derivative of vector direction. #rvc-eu $$ \\dot{\\hat{a}} = \\frac{1}{a}\\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}) $$  We take the definition #rvv-eu for the unit vector and differentiate it: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{a} &= \\frac{\\vec{a}}{a} \\\\ \\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{a} &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\vec{a}}{a}\\right) \\\\ \\dot{\\hat{a}} &= \\frac{\\dot{\\vec{a}} a - \\vec{a} \\dot{a}}{a^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\dot{\\vec{a}}}{a} - \\frac{\\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a}}{a^2} \\vec{a} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{a} \\big( \\dot{\\vec{a}} - (\\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a}) \\hat{a} \\big)\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{a} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}).\\end{aligned} $$ Here we observed at the end that we had the expression #rvv-em for the complementary projection of the derivative \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) with respect to \\( \\vec{a} \\) itself. An immediate consequence of the derivative of direction formula is that the derivative of a unit vector is always orthogonal to the unit vector: Derivative of unit vector is orthogonal. #rvc-eu2 $$ \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a} = 0 $$  From #rvc-eu we know that \\( \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\) is in the direction of \\( \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}) \\) , and from #rvv-er we know that this is orthogonal to \\( \\vec{a} \\) (and also \\( \\hat{a} \\)). Recall that we can always write a vector as the product of its length and direction, so \\( \\vec{a} = a \\hat{a} \\). This gives the following decomposition of the derivative of \\( \\vec{a} \\). Vector derivative decomposition. #rvc-em2 $$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\vec{a}} &=\\underbrace{\\dot{a}\\hat{a}}_{\\operatorname{Proj}(\\dot{\\vec{a}},\\vec{a})} + \\underbrace{a\\dot{\\hat{a}}}_{\\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}},\\vec{a})}\\end{aligned} $$  Differentiating \\( \\vec{a} = a \\hat{a} \\) and substituting in #rvv-el and #rvv-eu gives $$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\vec{a}} &= \\dot{a} \\hat{a} + a \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\\\ &= ( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a} ) \\hat{a} + a \\frac{1}{a} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\hat{a}) \\\\ &= \\operatorname{Proj}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}) + \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}). \\end{aligned} $$ animateresetlabels Show: derivative \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\)derivative decomposition Vector derivatives can be decomposed into length changes (projection onto \\( \\vec{a} \\)) and direction changes (complementary projection). Compare to Figure #rvv-fu. Spherical Coordinates The spherical coordinate system extends polar coordinates into 3D by using an angle \\(\\phi\\) for the third coordinate.

Then \\(z = r \\cos\\phi\\) and \\( \\ell = r \\sin\\phi \\), from which we obtain \\( x = \\ell \\cos\\theta \\) and \\( y = \\ell \\sin\\theta \\). To convert from Cartesian coordinates, we use the same projection and read off the expressions for the spherical coordinates. This uses the atan2 function to handle the different quadrants for \\(\\theta\\).

This gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_r &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_r = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_z \\times \\hat{e}_r = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_{\\theta} \\\\ \\dot{\\hat{e}}_{\\theta} &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_{\\theta} = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_z \\times \\hat{e}_{\\theta} = -\\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_r \\\\ \\dot{\\hat{e}}_{\\phi} &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_{\\phi} = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_z \\times \\hat{e}_z = 0 \\end{aligned} $$ where we used the fact that \\( \\hat{e}_r , \\hat{e}_{\\theta} , \\hat{e}_z \\) form a right-handed orthonormal basis to evaluate the cross products. A point \\(P\\) at a time-varying position \\((r,\\theta, z)\\) has position vector \\( \\vec{\\rho} \\), velocity \\( \\vec{v} = \\dot{\\vec{\\rho}} \\), and acceleration \\( \\vec{a} = \\ddot{\\vec{\\rho}} \\) given by the following expressions in cylindrical components. Position, velocity, and acceleration in cylindrical components. #rvy-ep $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{\\rho} &= r \\,\\hat{e}_r +z \\, \\hat{e}_z \\\\\\vec{v} &= \\dot{r} \\,\\hat{e}_r+ r \\dot\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_{\\theta}+ \\dot{z} \\,\\hat{e}_{z} \\\\\\vec{a} &= (\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\theta}^2) \\, \\hat{e}_r + (r \\ddot{\\theta} + 2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}) \\, \\hat{e}_{\\theta} + \\ddot{z} \\, \\hat{e}_z \\end{aligned} $$  From the coordinate expressions we see that the the position vector \\( \\vec{\\rho} \\), we know that \\( \\vec{\\rho} = r \\, \\hat{e}_r + z \\, \\hat{e}_Z \\). Differentiating this then gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v} &= \\dot{\\vec{\\rho}} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big(r \\, \\hat{e}_r + z \\, \\hat{e}_z\\Big) = \\dot{r} \\, \\hat{e}_r + r \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_r + \\dot{z} \\, \\hat{e}_z + z \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_z \\end{aligned} $$ and we substitute in the expression for \\( \\dot{\\hat{e}_r} \\) and \\( \\dot{\\hat{e}_z} \\) from above. Taking another derivative gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = \\dot{\\vec{v}} &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big( \\dot{r} \\,\\hat{e}_r + r \\dot\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_{\\theta} + \\dot{z} \\,\\hat{e}_{z} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\ddot{r} \\, \\hat{e}_r + \\dot{r} \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_r + (\\dot{r} \\dot\\theta + r \\ddot\\theta) \\, \\hat{e}_\\theta + r \\dot{\\theta} \\dot{\\hat{e}_{\\theta}} + \\ddot{z} \\hat{e}_z + \\dot{z} \\dot{\\hat{e}_z} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ and again we can substitute the basis vector derivatives. Warning! We normally write \\( \\vec{r} \\) for the position vector of a point, but if we are using cylindrical coordinates \\( r,\\theta ,z \\) then this is dangerous. This is because \\( r \\) might mean the magnitude of \\( \\vec{r} \\) or the radial coordinate, which are different. To avoid this confusion we use \\( \\vec{\\rho} \\) for the position vector and \\( r \\) for the radial coordinate. Applications Haystack antenna The Haystack antenna is a large radio telescope used for radar astronomy, atmospheric science, and satellite tracking. When tracking objects in space, such as satellites or celestial bodies, the orientation of the object relative to the antenna's coordinate system changes as both the object and the Earth move. The change of basis is used to transform the coordinates of the observed object from a global coordinate system (e.g., a celestial coordinate system) to a local coordinate system (relative to the antenna). This is essential for accurately pointing the antenna and tracking the object. Reference material Changing basis Did you know? The Haystack antenna was originally constructed in the 1960s for satellite tracking during the Cold War and has since been repurposed for scientific research. The antenna is housed in a radome, a dome-like structure, to protect it from weather conditions while allowing it to operate smoothly. This structure also affects the antenna's orientation calculations, requiring constant adjustments via vector transformations. Shortest flight paths If we want to fly from Urbana, USA to Delhi, India, which path should we follow? The locations of the two cities are: LatitudeLongitudeUrbana\\(\\phi = 40^\\circ 6' 35'' \\rm N\\)\\(\\lambda = 88^\\circ 12' 15'' \\rm W\\)Delhi\\(\\phi = 28^\\circ 36' 36'' \\rm N\\)\\(\\lambda = 77^\\circ 13' 48'' \\rm E\\) Geographic coordinates are typically given in spherical coordinates, but without the radius and with the angles given in degrees, minutes, and seconds, with the latitude first, and the direction given as North/South or East/West rather than positive/negative. Also note that latitude is the elevation angle up from the equator, whereas spherical coordinates often use the inclination angle down from the polar axis. Plotting the city locations on a map of the Earth gives the figure below. Such a map can give a very misleading idea of the shortest route, however. Show: straight path on mapshortest path Map of the Earth in an equirectangular projection, showing two possible flight paths from Urbana, USA to Delhi, India. Reference material Dot productSpherical coordinates Did you know? To get an idea of what it looks like to fly along a great circle path, we can view the crew movies taken from the ISS. The movies taken at night are especially evocative, such as this montage by Michael K\u00c3\u00b6nig. Technically the ISS is not following a great circle path around the Earth, because the Earth is rotating underneath it. However, because the speed of the ISS is much higher than the Earth's rotational velocity (90\u00c2\u00a0min versus 24\u00c2\u00a0h period), these paths are close to being great circles. Shortest paths on the sphere Finding the shortest distance between two points on the sphere is not a simple calculation given their latitude and longitude. As proved below, the shortest path on the sphere is always a great circle, which is the intersection of the sphere with a plane through the origin. The shortest distance calculation thus reduces to finding the angle between the vectors \\( \\vec{OA} \\) and \\( \\vec{OB} \\), which can be easily done by finding their dot product after changing them to rectangular coordinates.

Because the sphere is curved, a map projection cannot preserve both areas and angles simultaneously, leading to different trade-offs in choosing an appropriate projection for a given purpose. Some common projections are shown below. Equirectangular. $$ x = \\lambda, \\quad y = \\phi $$ Mercator: cylindrical, conformal (angle-preserving). $$ x = \\lambda, \\quad y = \\log\\left(\\tan\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi}{2}\\Big)\\right) $$ Hobo-Dyer: cylindrical, area-preserving. $$ x = \\lambda, \\quad y = \\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\cos^2(37.5^\\circ)} $$ Winkel tripel: non-cylindrical, compromise. $$ \\begin{aligned}\\small x &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\lambda \\cos\\phi_1 + \\frac{2\\cos\\phi\\sin\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}{{\\rm sinc}\\,\\alpha}\\right) \\\\ y &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\phi + \\frac{\\sin\\phi}{{\\rm sinc}\\,\\alpha}\\right) \\\\ \\alpha &= \\arccos\\Big(\\cos\\phi \\cos\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\Big) \\\\ \\phi_1 &= \\arccos\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\end{aligned} $$ You might also be interested in what your choice of map projection says about your personality. Proof that great circles are shortest paths Given any two points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) on the surface of the Earth, we choose coordinate axes and use spherical coordinates so that \\( A \\) is at \\( (r = r_0, \\theta = 0, \\phi = \\pi - \\phi_0) \\) and \\( B \\) is at \\( (r = r_0, \\theta = 0, \\phi = \\pi + \\phi_0) \\). Here \\( r_0 \\) is the radius of the Earth and \\( 0 \\le \\phi_0 \\le \\pi/2 \\). The total angle between \\( \\vec{OA} \\) and \\( \\vec{OB} \\) is \\( \\Delta\\phi = 2\\phi_0 \\), so the great-circle distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\( r_0 \\Delta\\phi \\). We will now prove that this is the smallest possible distance. Consider any path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) on the Earth's surface. Suppose we travel along this path, starting at \\(A\\) at time \\(t = 0\\) and ending at \\(B\\) at time \\(t = 1\\). Then the position vector at time \\(t\\) is given by \\( \\vec{r}(t) \\) with spherical coordinates \\(r_0\\), \\(\\theta(t)\\), \\(\\phi(t)\\) and rectangular coordinates \\(x(t), y(t), z(t)\\). The length \\(L\\) of our path can be computed by integrating the speed from the start time to the end time: $$ L = \\int_0^1 \\| \\dot{\\vec{r}} \\| \\, dt= \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2} \\, dt. $$ To switch from rectangular to spherical coordinates we use the conversion: $$ \\begin{aligned} x &= r \\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi \\\\ y &= r \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\\\ z &= r \\cos\\phi. \\end{aligned} $$ Differentiating these expressions and substituting (or using the spherical velocity expression) gives the path length expression: $$ L = \\int_0^1 r_0 \\sqrt{\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin^2\\phi} \\, dt\\ge \\int_0^1 r_0 |\\dot{\\phi}| \\, dt\\ge r_0 \\Delta \\phi. $$ Here we have used the fact that \\( \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin^2\\phi \\ge 0 \\) to see that \\(L\\) must be at least as big as the great-circle distance \\(r_0 \\Delta \\phi\\). Thus the great-circle distance is the minimum path length between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the surface of the sphere. Did you know? All the calculations on this page have assumed a spherical model of the Earth, given by $$ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2, $$ where the radius of the Earth is \\(R = 6371\\rm\\ km.\\) Because it spins with a period of about 24 hours, the Earth bulges outwards so the center is further from the equator than from the poles. A shape that better approximates the true Earth is thus an ellipsoid, given by: $$ \\left(\\frac{x}{R_{\\rm xy}}\\right)^2+ \\left(\\frac{y}{R_{\\rm xy}}\\right)^2+ \\left(\\frac{z}{R_{\\rm z}}\\right)^2 = 1, $$ where \\( R_{\\rm xy} = 6378\\rm\\ km \\) and \\( R_{\\rm z} = 6357\\rm\\ km. \\) Computing shortest path distances on ellipsoids turns out to be much harder than shortest paths on spheres. One set of equations for doing this are known as Vincenty's formulae. There is no single best ellipsoid that fits the Earth. Instead there are many different ellipsoids in use, each of which fit the Earth better near different countries (e.g., NAD 83 for North America and WGS 84 for GPS world-wide). When even more accuracy is needed, such as for satellite orbit modeling, then true geoid models are used, with spherical harmonic expansions determined from satellite gravity measurements.",

A more complete proof in 3D uses the law of cosines. Start with two vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) with an angle \\( \\theta \\) between them, as shown below. Observe that the angle \\( \\theta \\) between vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) is the difference between the angles \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) from horizontal. If we use the angle sum formula for cosine, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= a b \\cos(\\theta_b - \\theta_a) \\\\ &= a b (\\cos\\theta_b \\cos\\theta_a + \\sin\\theta_b \\sin\\theta_a) \\end{aligned} $$ We now want to express the sine and cosine of \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) in terms of the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\). We re-arrange the expression so that we can use the fact that \\( a_1 = a \\cos\\theta_a \\) and \\( a_2 = a \\sin\\theta_a \\), and similarly for \\( \\vec{b} \\). This gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= (a \\cos\\theta_a) (b \\cos\\theta_b) + (a \\sin\\theta_a) (b \\sin\\theta_b) \\\\ &= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\end{aligned} $$ The fact that we can write the dot product in terms of components as well as in terms of lengths and angle is very helpful for calculating the length and angles of vectors from the component representations. Length and angle from dot product. #rvv-el $$ \\begin{aligned} a &= \\sqrt{\\vec{a} \\cdot\\vec{a}} \\\\ \\cos\\theta &= \\frac{\\vec{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}}{b a}\\end{aligned} $$  The angle between \\( \\vec{a} \\) and itself is $\\theta = 0$, so \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} = a^2 \\cos 0 = a^2 \\), which gives the first equation for the length in terms of the dot product. The second equation is a rearrangement of #rvv-ed. If two vectors have zero dot product \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 \\) then they have an angle of \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\rm\\ rad \\) between them and we say that the vectors are perpendicular, orthogonal, or normal to each other. In 2D we can easily find a perpendicular vector by rotating \\( \\vec{a} \\) counterclockwise with the following equation.

In 2D there are two perpendicular directions to a given vector \\( \\vec{a} \\), given by \\( \\vec{a}^\\perp \\) and \\( -\\vec{a}^\\perp \\).

Instead, if we have more than one cross product, we should always use parentheses to indicate the order. Rather than using components, the cross product can be defined by specifying the length and direction of the resulting vector. The direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\) is orthogonal to both \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), with the direction given by the right-hand rule. The magnitude of the cross product is given by: Cross product length. #rvv-el2 $$ \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\| = a b \\sin\\theta $$  Using Lagrange's identity we can calculate: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\|^2 &= \\|\\vec{a}\\|^2 \\|\\vec{b}\\|^2 - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 - (a b \\cos\\theta)^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 (1 - \\cos^2\\theta) \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 \\sin^2\\theta. \\end{aligned} $$ Taking the square root of this expression gives the desired cross-product length formula. This second form of the cross product definition can also be related to the area of a parallelogram. The area of a parallelogram is the length of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height, which is also the magnitude of the cross product of the side vectors. A useful special case of the cross product occurs when vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane and the other vector is in the orthogonal \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction. In this case the cross product rotates \\( \\vec{a} \\) by \\( 90^\\circ \\) counterclockwise to give the perpendicular vector \\( \\vec{a}^\\perp \\), as follows.

They don't rely on any basis or coordinates, but are just defined in terms of the physical actions of adding and scaling vectors. reset labels Increment: \\(\\Delta t = \\) 2 s Show: vector increment \\( \\Delta\\vec{a} \\) approximate derivative \\( \\Delta\\vec{a} / \\Delta t \\) exact derivative \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) Time: \\(t = \\) 0 s Vector derivatives shown as functions of \\(t\\) and \\(\\Delta t\\).

Alternatively, we can hold \\(\\Delta t\\) fixed and vary \\(t\\) to see how the approximation changes depending on how \\( \\vec{a} \\) is changing. We will use either the dot notation \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}}(t) \\) (also known as Newton notation) or the full derivative notation \\( \\frac{d\\vec{a}(t)}{dt} \\) (also known as Leibniz notation), depending on which is clearer and more convenient. We will often not write the time dependency explicitly, so we might write just \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) or \\( \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{dt} \\). See below for more details. Newton versus Leibniz Notation Most people know who Isaac Newton is, but perhaps fewer have heard of Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz was a prolific mathematician and a contemporary of Newton. Both of them claimed to have invented calculus independently of each other, and this became the source of a bitter rivalry between the two of them. Each of them had different notation for derivatives, and both notations are commonly used today. Leibniz notation is meant to be reminiscent of the definition of a derivative: $$ \\frac{dy}{dt}=\\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t}. $$ Newton notation is meant to be compact: $$ \\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt}. $$ Note that a superscribed dot always denotes differentiation with respect to time \\(t\\). A superscribed dot is never used to denote differentiation with respect to any other variable, such as \\(x\\). But what about primes? A prime is used to denote differentiation with respect to a function's argument. For example, suppose we have a function \\(f=f(x)\\). Then $$ f'(x) = \\frac{df}{dx}. $$ Suppose we have another function \\(g=g(s)\\). Then $$ g'(s) = \\frac{dg}{ds}. $$ As you can see, while a superscribed dot always denotes differentiation with respect to time \\(t\\), a prime can denote differentiation with respect to any variable; but that variable is always the function's argument. Sometimes, for convenience, we drop the argument altogether. So, if we know that \\(y=y(x)\\), then \\(y'\\) is understood to be the same as \\(y'(x)\\). This is sloppy, but it is very common in practice. Each notation has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of Newton notation is that it is compact: it does not take a lot of effort to write a dot or a prime over a variable. However, the price you pay for convenience is clarity. The main advantage of Leibniz notation is that it is absolutely clear exactly which variable you are differentiating with respect to. Notice how, with Leibniz notation, you can imagine the \\(dx\\)'s \"cancelling out\" on the right-hand side, leaving you with \\(dy/dt\\). Derivatives and vector \"positions\" When thinking about vector derivatives, it is important to remember that vectors don't have positions. Even if a vector is drawn moving about, this is irrelevant for the derivative. Only changes to length and direction are important. animate reset Show: derivative at \\(t = 0\\) \\( \\vec{a}(t) \\) with fixed base derivative at current \\(t\\) Movement: bounce stretch circle twist slider rotate vertical fly Vector derivatives for moving vectors. Vector movement is irrelevant when computing vector derivatives.

If they are, then we need to take this into account as well. reset labels Time: \\(t = \\) 0 s Show: derivative first component second component Basis: \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v} \\) The vector derivative decomposed into components.

Consider the following examples of the chain rule in the two notations: $$ \\begin{aligned}&\\text{Newton:}&\\dot{y}=y'(x)\\dot{x} \\\\ &\\text{Leibniz:}&\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\frac{dx}{dt}.\\end{aligned} $$ Notice how, with Leibniz notation, you can imagine the \\(dx\\)'s \"cancelling out\" on the right-hand side, leaving you with \\(dy/dt\\). The chain rule also applies to vector functions. This is helpful for parameterizing vectors in terms of arc-length \\(s\\) or other quantities different than time \\(t\\). Chain rule for vectors. $$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec{a} (s(t)) = \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{ds}(s(t)) \\frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{ds} \\dot{s} $$ + Example Problem: Chain rule. #vcc-chr A vector is defined in terms of an angle \\(\\theta\\) by \\( \\vec{r}(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat\\jmath \\).

We can use the chain rule to compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec{r} &= \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\vec{r} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} \\theta \\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\Big( \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat\\jmath \\Big) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} (t^3) \\right) \\\\ &= \\left(\\Big( -\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat\\imath + \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat\\jmath \\Big) \\cdot (3 t^2) \\right) \\\\ &= -3 t^2 \\sin(t^3)\\,\\hat\\imath + 3 t^2 \\cos(t^3)\\,\\hat\\jmath \\end{aligned} $$ Alternatively, we can evaluate \\( \\vec{r} \\) as a function of \\(t\\) first and then differentiate it with respect to time, using the scalar chain rule for each component: $$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec{r} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\Big( \\cos(t^3)\\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin(t^3)\\,\\hat\\jmath \\Big) \\ = -3 t^2 \\sin(t^3)\\,\\hat\\imath + 3 t^2 \\cos(t^3),\\hat\\jmath $$ Integration Cartesian: $$ \\vec{v} = \\dot{x} \\hat\\imath + \\dot{y} \\hat\\jmath $$ Integrate \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) to find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

    "text": "Particle Kinetics Classical mechanics Newton's equations relate the acceleration \\( \\vec{a} \\) of a point mass with mass \\( m \\) to the total applied force \\( \\vec{F} \\) on the mass (sum of all applied forces). They are: Newton's equations: $$ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} $$ There is no derivation for Newton's equations, because they are an assumed model for dynamics. We can only verify them by comparing with experimental evidence, which confirms that Newtonian dynamics are accurate for non-relativistic and non-quantum systems. animate reset A point mass moving in the plane with an applied force. You can try to made the mass move in a circle and then see what happens when the force is suddenly removed, which will demonstrate Newton's first law (no net force implies motion at constant speed in a constant direction). Also observe which force directions cause the speed to increase or decrease. Click and drag to impart a force on the particle. Did you know? If we have objects which are either very massive, very small, or moving very fast, then Newton's equations do not provide a good model of their motion. Instead we must use Einstein's equations of general relativity (for massive and fast objects) or the equations of quantum mechanics (for very small objects). Unfortunately, these two theories cannot be used together, so we currently have no good models for objects which are simultaneously very small and very massive, such as micro black holes or the universe shortly after the big bang. Physicists are currently trying to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics by devising a new set of equations (sometimes called quantum gravity or a theory of everything). Current possibilities for new equations include string theory and loop quantum gravity, but none of these are generally accepted yet. It is important to remember that all of these different equations are only models of reality and are not actually real: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll models are wrong. Some models are useful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Box Method of assumed forces and method of assumed motion Newton's equations can be used in two main ways. Either we know the forces and we use this to compute the acceleration of a mass, or we know the acceleration and use this to compute the forces. $$ \\begin{align}\\textbf{Method of assumed forces: } \\text{Know } \\vec{F} \\Longrightarrow \\text{Compute } \\vec{a} \\\\ \\textbf{Method of assumed motion: } \\text{Know } \\vec{a} \\Longrightarrow \\text{Compute } \\vec{F} \\end{align} $$ Of course there are other possibilities from these two, such as knowing the vertical component of the force and the horizontal component of acceleration, and then computing the missing components of each. + Example Problem: Method of assumed forces #rep-xf A cannonball of mass \\( m \\) is fired from the origin with initial velocity \\( \\vec{v}_0 \\) and then experiences a force \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} = -m g \\hat{\\jmath} \\) due to gravity and a wind force \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm w} = -C_{\\rm w} \\hat{\\imath} \\).

We can use Newton's equations to find the acceleration of the cannonball, using the method of assumed forces: $$ \\begin{aligned} m \\vec{a} &= \\vec{F}_{\\rm w} + \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} \\\\ \\vec{a} &= \\frac{1}{m} \\left( - C_{\\rm w} \\hat{\\imath} - m g \\hat{\\jmath} \\right) \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Method of assumed motion #rep-xm A car of mass \\( m \\) is observed driving on a sinusoidal road at a constant horizontal speed \\( v_0 \\).

First, we find the acceleration: $$ \\begin{aligned} x(t) &= x_0 + v_0 t \\\\ \\vec{r}(t) &= x(t)\\,\\hat{\\imath} + y(x(t)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= (x_0 + v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\imath} + A \\sin(k x_0 + k v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{a}(t) = \\ddot{\\vec{r}}(t) &= - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x_0 + k v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\jmath}. \\end{aligned} $$ Given the force of gravity \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} = - m g \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\) and the road force \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} \\), Newton's equations give the forces as: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} + \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} &= m \\vec{a} \\\\ \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} &= - m A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} + m g \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= m \\Big(g - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\Big) \\,\\hat{\\jmath}, \\end{aligned} $$ where we have solved for the road force on the car. Solution steps The steps involved in analyzing a mechanical system with Newton's equations are as follows. $$ \\begin{aligned} &\\text{1. FBD: draw a Free Body Diagram.} \\\\ &\\text{2.

What is the equation of motion for \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) and the tension \\( T \\) in the rod?  It is helpful in this problem to use both Cartesian and polar bases: show bases 1. FBD: The free body diagram for the point mass is: The forces on the free body diagram are: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{F}_g &= - mg \\,\\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\vec{F}_T &= - T \\,\\hat{e}_r. \\end{aligned} $$ 2.

We will convert to \\( \\hat{e}_r,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\) using: $$ \\hat\\jmath = -\\cos\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_r + \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta, $$ which gives: $$ (-T + mg\\cos\\theta)\\,\\hat{e}_r - mg\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{e}_\\theta = -m\\ell \\dot\\theta^2 \\,\\hat{e}_r + m\\ell\\ddot\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta. $$ Equating the \\( \\hat{e}_\\theta \\) and \\( \\hat{e}_r \\) terms gives \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) and \\( T \\) by: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ddot\\theta &= - \\frac{g}{\\ell} \\sin\\theta \\\\ T &= mg\\cos\\theta + m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2. \\end{aligned} $$ A free-body diagram (abbreviated as FBD, also called force diagram) is a diagram used to show the magnitude and direction of all applied forces, moments, and reaction and constraint forces acting on a body. They are important and necessary in solving complex problems in mechanics. What is and is not included in a free-body diagram is important. Every free-body diagram should have the following: The body represented as a dot if it is a point mass, and the body itself if it is a rigid body. The external forces/moments. The force vector should indicate: relative magnitude, point of application, and the direction. A properly defined coordinate system A free-body diagram should not include the following: Bodies other than the body we are interested in. Forces applied by the body Internal forces depending on the chosen system. For example, a free-body diagram on a truss should not include the forces between individual truss members. Kinematic quantities (velocity and acceleration). Warning! Always assume the direction of forces/moments to be positive according to the appropriate coordinate system. The calculations from Newton/Euler equations will provide you with the correct direction of those forces/moments. Things that should not follow this are: Gravity Tension Friction if the velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\) is provided Warning! If forces/moments are present, always begin with a free-body diagram. Do not write down equations before drawing the FBD as those are often simple kinematic equations, or Newton/Euler equations. Numerical integration Independent variable (time).

Applications Accelerating and braking What happens when we step on the gas or brake in a car? The car pushes against the road to either accelerate (gas pedal) or decelerate (brake pedal). But how are the forces on the car and wheels distributed? What determines whether the wheels grip the road or lose traction and spin or slide? To study this problem we need a model. Let's start with the simplest model and then gradually consider more complex models. The classic American Pony Car: a 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. Image source: flikr image by Nick Ares (CC BY-SA 2.0) (full-sized image). The simplest model of a car is to treat the entire vehicle as a point mass. On a free body diagram we have vertical force balance for a stationary car. When the car accelerates, there is a horizontal forward force on the car, and a corresponding backwards horizontal force on the ground. As the car picks up speed, air resistance produces a backwards force. On the diagram we have drawn some forces offset from the center of mass, so that the vectors don't overlap. Because we are assuming a point mass model, however, all vectors are really acting at the same point. While cruising at a constant speed, there is a balance between the horizontal driving force and the drag force due to air resistance. When the car brakes, there is a backwards force that slows the car down to a stop. accelerate brake free body diagram components animation We can think of the force vectors (such as the ground force on the car) as either in separate horizontal and vertical components or as unified vectors. It may be helpful to pause the animation during acceleration and braking to consider the forces at work.

Video of braking in which the rear wheels lose contact. Another burnout video, taken to the point of destruction. Banked turns Turning in a circle requires a vehicle to have a centripetal acceleration inwards on the turn, and so there must be some centripetal force that produces this acceleration. For a vehicle driving on flat ground, this force must be produced by a sideways friction force on the tires. This introduces two problems: If the coefficient of friction is not high enough (say the road is wet or icy), then the friction force will be insufficient and the vehicle will slide off the road. Even if the friction force is high enough, because it acts at the bottom of the tires, it produces a net moment about the center of mass, which can cause the vehicle to roll over. To avoid both of these problems, the road can be banked inwards, so that the outer edge of the road is higher than the inner edge. This is called superelevation and means that some of the centripetal force can be provided by the normal force with the road, reducing the friction force and minimizing the risk of slip or roll. The figure below shows a bus driving around a sharp corner at high speed on a heavily banked road. To understand the dynamics of this vehicle and the design tradeoffs for cornering on banked turns, we need a model. We will start below with a simple point mass model, which will be enough to understand friction and sliding, and then move on to a 2D rigid-body body to understand roll behavior.

This 10.16 m long coach model is relatively compact and has short overhangs, allowing it to traverse the sharp banked corner at about 100 km/h.

Video taken from inside a car driving around the Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim track. Track geometry To understand the dynamics of the bus above, we first need a simple model of the geometry of the road. A satellite photo of the track is shown below. The bus was photographed while on the far-left-hand curve, which we can see is approximately a half-circle with radius about 50 m. Satellite image of the Mercedes-Benz test track at Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim, on the Neckar River just outside of Stuttgart, Germany. The picture of the bus above was taken on the far-left-hand corner, which has a radius of curvature of about 50 m. Integrated with the test track is the excellent Mercedes-Benz Museum. To make a simple model, let us consider a track with straight segments and half-circular ends, as shown below. If we animate the bus then we can see the vectors for velocity, acceleration, and force as the bus drives around the track. We assume constant speed, so there is only an acceleration when the velocity changes direction around the corners. This model assumes semi-circular track ends, but this is not a good idea in practice. animate show vectors The centripetal acceleration must be caused by an inwards force while going around the corners. To understand the magnitude and source of this force, we now consider a simple point mass model. Did you know? The modern automobile was invented in 1885 by Karl Benz in Mannheim, Germany, about 100 km from Stuttgart. The commercial success of the new invention was significantly aided by Benz' wife Bertha, who marketed the automobile by making the world's first road trip, inventing brake linings in the process. Driven by the post-WWI German economic crisis and hyperinflation, the Benz company later merged with Daimler to form Daimler-Benz, and began producing Mercedes-Benz cars in Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim, just outside of Stuttgart, where it is still headquartered. One of the company's engineers, Ferdinand Porsche, later founded his own company, which is also still based in Stuttgart. Point mass model Consider the bus as a single point mass on the track while going around the corner. The diagram below shows the bus front-on, so the inside of the track is towards the left. We start by assuming there is no bank on the road and that the bus is stationary. The free body diagram shows that the gravity force \\(W\\) is balanced by the normal force \\(N\\) from the road. If we now increase the bank angle \\(\\theta\\) below, then we see that a friction force \\(F\\) tangential to the road is needed to keep the bus from sliding. In practice, this force will be limited by \\(F \\le \\mu N\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the coefficient of friction. If we incline the track until it is nearly vertical, we see that there a huge friction force would be required but only a tiny normal force is available. As this would not be possible without gluing the tires to the road, this situation would result in the bus sliding downwards towards the center of the track. free body diagram components Road bank angle: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 45\\(^\\circ\\) Bus speed: \\(v = \\; \\) 30 \\(\\rm m/s\\) Now set the bank angle back to \\(0^\\circ\\) and make sure the speed is zero and that the free body diagram is visible. Now increase the speed of the bus to produce a centripetal acceleration. Newton's law implies that there must be a centripetal friction force producing this acceleration. As the speed increases, we will eventually reach a point when the friction force required is too large and the bus will slide outwards on the track. To avoid sliding outwards, we can increase the bank on the road. This increases the normal force and decreases the friction force, making it less likely that sliding will occur. For any given speed, there is some angle that exactly cancels the friction force, so that all the force is normal force. This is a very safe driving situation, as no sliding is possible, even in very slippery road conditions. On the real track, the bank angle increases as the bus drives higher. This allows the driver to select the correct incline angle to minimize sliding risk. We can also show the forces in components or as total vectors as we change the bank angle and bus speed. While this simple point mass model allows us to understand how banking the road can help with the problem of sliding, it does not tell us anything about rolling of the vehicle, because point masses can't rotate. We thus need a rigid body model to investigate roll. Did you know? Higher speed and a smaller radius of curvature on a circular track requires higher bank angles, as in the photo below. Mercedes-Benz models 450 SL and 450 SLC in the front, with models 450 SE and 450 SEL behind, on the Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim test track in 1973. Image credit: Daimler Global Media Site (full-sized image, original rotated image). 2D Rigid body model We now use a single rigid body model for the bus and we will do everything in 2D. Below we see a front-on diagram of the bus, with the inside of the track to the left. If we turn on the free body diagram, then we see that the weight of the bus is supported by two forces, one on each wheel. If we increase \\(\\theta\\) then the weight is supported more by the down-slope wheel, and we also see sideways friction forces appear to stop the bus from sliding. If the slope becomes too steep, then the normal force on the up-slope wheel reverses direction, indicating that it is holding the wheel down onto the road. Physically this cannot happen, so at this point the bus would tip over. We needed this rigid-body model to understand this tipping behavior, as we couldn't model this with the point mass model. Depending on the value of the friction coefficient, the bus may either slide or roll first as \\(\\theta\\) increases. free body diagram components Road bank angle: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 45\\(^\\circ\\) Bus speed: \\(v = \\; \\) 30 \\(\\rm m/s\\) If we now set the bank angle \\(\\theta\\) back to zero, we can start to increase the speed \\(v\\). Now we see that the wheel on the inside of the track takes less of the weight, and the friction forces now stop the bus from sliding outwards on the track. If the bus goes too fast then it will roll outwards on the track (assuming the friction coefficient is high enough that it didn't slide first). Having considered both a banked road with stationary bus, and a moving bus on a horizontal road, we can now combine them to see the advantage of having a banked road when the bus is cornering. Choose a bus velocity, and then change the bank angle \\(\\theta\\), so that the friction force is reduced (helping to avoid sliding) and the normal forces on the wheels are more evenly balanced (helping to avoid rolling). For any given speed, we can choose a bank angle so that there is simultaneously no sideways friction force and also exactly balanced normal forces. This is the safest bank angle for this speed. Design of roads, tracks, and rail A straight road generally has the center somewhat higher than the edges to allow water to run off. This is called cross slope or camber. When it is desired to have a banked turn, then the outer edge of the road is raised to produce superelevation, with the outer edge rising above both the center and the inner edge. The bank angle is chosen based on the radius of curvature of the turn and the expected speed of cars going around the turn, while still allowing for the fact that cars might be moving slowly or even stopped. The angle should thus not be chosen to eliminate all friction forces when cars are traveling at maximum speed, as this would be dangerous if traffic had to stop on the road. Velodromes are arenas with tracks designed for high-speed bicycle races, as shown below, with speeds up to 85 km/h. The bank angle on velodrome tracks is chosen to minimize sideways forces on the bicycles when they are traveling at near maximum speeds, so the angle chosen depends on the radius of curvature of the track corners. For example, the Blaine velodrome track pictured below is 250 m long and has a 43\u00b0 bank angle on the corners and 15\u00b0 banking on the straightaways. Bicycle riders on a banked turn at the Blaine velodrome, part of the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota. Image source: flikr user flyinfoto (CC BY 2.0) (full-sized image). High-speed trains such as the French TGV operate at speeds of over 300 km/h and have run at up to 575 km/h. To accommodate cornering at such speeds, track bends are constructed with a large radius of curvature (at least 7 km for new tracks) and a bank angle of up to about 7\u00b0 (180 mm maximum superelevation with Standard gauge of 1435 mm). For railways, banking the track is know as cant. An alternative approach for cornering with trains is to leave the track relatively flat and to tilt the train as it travels around a corner. This allows high-speed trains to operate on regular tracks, while maintaining safety and comfort for the passengers. For example, the Queensland Rail Tilt Train operates at 180 km/h by tilting at up to 5\u00b0 around corners. As we see from our rigid body analysis above, tilting the train will help with avoiding tipping over at high speeds, but will not help with reducing horizontal friction forces. Even with a tilting train, entering a curve at too high a speed will lead to disastrous results. Did you know? The Blaine velodrome in Minnesota was designed by the famous Schuermann velodrome architects and built from the extremely durable African Afzelia hardwood. Velodrome races are always counter-clockwise and use special bikes with fixed chains (no freewheeling, no gears) and no brakes. The corners are scarily steep: Image credit: Tom McGoldrick (full sized image). Did you know? High-speed trains such as the French TGV and German ICE require many sophisticated engineering techniques to enable travel at extreme speed. Very smooth rails are needed, so the track is formed by welding the segments together into one precisely-aligned continuous steel line. The steel rails conduct heat too well for conventional welding, so thermite welding is used to join the track segments. At high speeds the train drivers are unable to see railway signals on the side of the track. Electronic signaling systems are used to communicate to the drivers, either through the tracks for the TGV or via additional cables for the ICE. Friction-based brakes produce too much heat, as they would need to absorb the kinetic energy of several hundred tonnes of train moving at over 300 km/h. Instead, dynamic breaking is used, in which the electric motors powering the trains are run in reverse as generators and the energy is shed as heat in resistor arrays. At extremely high speeds, the wheels themselves cannot provide sufficient traction to enable braking, so technologies like magnetic induction brakes are being developed, which directly push against the rails without involving the wheels at all. Bus model The bus model used above is a Setra S 411 HD coach. The mass of the vehicle is 12.6 t and the dimensions are shown below. $$ \\begin{aligned} h_1 &= {0.87\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_1 &= {0.30\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_2 &= {2.24\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_2 &= {0.97\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_3 &= {0.97\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_4 &= {0.30\\rm\\ m} \\end{aligned} $$ Projectiles with air resistance Consider a spherical object, such as a baseball, moving through the air. The motion of an object though a fluid is one of the most complex problems in all of science, and it is still not completely understood to this day. One of the reasons this problem is so challenging is that, in general, there are many different forces acting on such objects, including: gravity drag lift thrust buoyancy bulk fluid motion, such as wind inertial forces, such as the centrifugal and Coriolis forces In most introductory physics and dynamics courses, gravity is the only force that is accounted for (this is equivalent to assuming that the motion takes place in a vacuum). Here we will consider realistic and accurate models of air resistance that are used to model the motion of projectiles like baseballs. Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois is the home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. In baseball, an \u00e2\u0080\u009cout of the park\u00e2\u0080\u009d home run is scored when the ball is hit beyond the green outfield (past the yellow foul pole at the left of the above image). Image source: Flickr image by Mike Bash (CC BY NC ND 2.0) (full-sized image). Drag forces and drag coefficients The drag force is always directly opposed to the velocity of the object. In vector notation, $$ \\vec{F}_{\\rm D} = -F_{\\rm D} \\hat{v}, $$ where \\( F_{\\rm D} \\) is the magnitude of the drag force, and \\( \\hat{v} \\) is the unit vector in the direction of the object's velocity. Velocity angle from horizontal: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 30\\(^\\circ\\) The free body diagram for a baseball subject to gravity and air resistance. Observe that the drag due to air resistance is always in the opposite direction to the velocity. Image credit: Microsoft clip art. The magnitude of the drag force is characterized by the dimensionless drag coefficient \\( C_{\\rm D} \\), given by $$ C_{\\rm D} = \\frac{F_{\\rm D}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^2}, $$ where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the fluid (in this case, air), \\( A=(1/4)\\pi D^{2} \\) is the cross-sectional area of the object, and \\( v \\) is the object's speed. Drag coefficients as a function of Reynolds number A dimensionless parameter that is very useful in fluid dynamics is the Reynolds number, which is defined as $$ {\\rm Re} = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}, $$ where \\( L \\) is a characteristic length for the flow (in this case, the diameter \\( D \\) of the ball), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. The Reynolds number gives a ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces in a fluid flow. For very small Reynolds numbers, the viscous forces are much stronger than the inertial forces (think of trying to stir a cup of honey). For very large Reynolds numbers, the viscous forces are negligible, and we refer to the flow as inviscid (think of stirring a cup of coffee). An important result in fluid dynamics is that the drag coefficient is a function only of the Reynolds number of the fluid flow about the object. That is, $$ C_{\\rm D} = C_{\\rm D}({\\rm Re}). $$ This functional relationship has no closed form. However, the relationship has been established numerically based on experimental data. See Figure #aft-fd for a schematic diagram of the drag coefficient's dependence on the Reynolds number. Experimental dependence of drag coefficient on Reynolds number for a sphere. Image credit: NASA via Wikipedia. Quadratic drag model Notice from Figure #aft-fd that there is a range of Reynolds numbers (\\( 10^3 < {\\rm Re} < 10^5 \\)), characteristic of macroscopic projectiles, for which the drag coefficient is approximately constant at about 1/2 (see the part of the curve labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009c4\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Figure #aft-fd). That the drag coefficient is constant means that, within this region, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speed. Substituting \\( C_{\\rm D}=1/2 \\) into the definition of \\( C_{D} \\) above, we obtain $$ F_{\\rm D} = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho A v^2 = c v^2, $$ where we have defined the quadratic drag parameter \\(c\\) as $$ c = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho A = \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\rho D^2, $$ which is a constant for a given projectile. This is referred to as quadratic drag, because the drag force magnitude is proportional to the square of the speed. Using this result, we can write the drag force vector as $$ \\vec{F}_{\\rm D} = - c v^2 \\hat{v}. $$ In the presence of gravity and quadratic drag alone, the net force on an object is given by $$ \\sum \\vec{F} = m \\vec{g} - c v^2 \\hat{v}, $$ where \\( m \\) is the mass of the object and \\( \\vec{g} \\) is the local acceleration due to gravity. Below is an interactive graphic showing the trajectory of an object with gravity and quadratic drag.

A rotation consists of a rotation axis and a rotation rate. By taking the rotation axis as a direction and the rotation rate as a length, we can write the rotation as a vector, known as the angular velocity vector\\( \\vec{\\omega} \\). We use the right-hand rule to describe the direction of rotation. The units of \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) are \\(\\rm rad/s\\) or \\( {}^\\circ/s \\). animatereset Rotation axis: \\( \\hat\\imath \\)\\( \\hat\\jmath \\)\\( \\hat{k} \\)\\( \\hat\\imath + \\hat\\jmath \\)\\( \\hat\\imath + \\hat\\jmath + \\hat{k} \\) Angular velocity vector \\(\\vec\\omega\\). The direction of \\(\\vec\\omega\\) is the axis of rotation, while the magnitude is the speed of rotation (positive direction given by the right-hand rule). If an object is rotating with angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) about a fixed origin, then the velocity and acceleration are given by the following relations: Velocity and acceleration about a fixed origin. #rkv-ef $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v} &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r} \\\\ \\vec{a} &= \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}) \\end{aligned} $$ Did you know?

This shows that the idea of an alphabet is so non-obvious that it has only ever been invented once, and then always copied after that.

Derivative of constant-length vectors. #rkr-el $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}\\qquad\\text{if \\(\\vec{a}\\) is constant length}\\ $$  This can be seen from the fact that \\( \\dot{a} = 0 \\) if \\(a\\) is constant (a fixed length vector), substituted into #rkr-ed. Rotations in 2D In 2D the angular velocity can be thought of as a scalar (positive for counter-clockwise, negative for clockwise). This scalar is just the out-of-plane component of the full angular velocity vector. We can draw the angular velocity as either a vector pointing out of the plane, or as a circle-arrow in the plane, which is simpler for 2D diagrams. animatereset Show: derivative Comparison of the vector and scalar representations of \\(\\vec\\omega\\) for 2D rotations. In 2D the angular velocity scalar \\(\\omega\\) is simply the derivative of the rotation angle \\(\\theta\\) in the plane: Magnitude \\(\\omega\\) is derivative of angle \\(\\theta\\) in 2D. #rkr-e2 $$ \\omega = \\dot\\theta $$  Take \\( \\hat{a} \\) to be a unit vector rotating in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath\u00e2\u0080\u0093\\hat\\jmath \\) plane, making an angle of \\(\\theta\\) with the \\(x\\)-axis, as in Figure #rkr-f2. Then: $$ \\hat{a} = \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath. $$ Differentiating this expression gives: $$ \\dot{\\hat{a}} = -\\sin\\theta \\, \\dot\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath+ \\cos\\theta \\,\\dot\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath. $$ We now consider an angular velocity vector \\(\\vec\\omega\\). Because the rotation is in the \\(\\hat\\imath\\)\u00e2\u0080\u0093\\(\\hat\\jmath\\) plane, the angular velocity vector must be in the \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction. Thus \\( \\vec\\omega = \\omega \\hat{k} \\). Now we can compute the derivative of \\( \\hat{a} \\) using #rkr-ew, giving: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\dot{\\hat{a}} &= \\vec\\omega \\times \\hat{a} \\\\&= \\omega\\hat{k} \\times \\big( \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath+ \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath \\big) \\\\&= \\omega \\cos\\theta \\,(\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\imath)+ \\omega \\sin\\theta \\,(\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\jmath) \\\\&= \\omega \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath+ \\omega \\sin\\theta \\,(-\\hat\\imath) \\\\&= - \\omega \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath+ \\omega \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath.\\end{aligned} $$ Comparing this expression to the earlier one for \\( \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\)we see that \\(\\omega = \\dot\\theta\\). The right-hand rule convention for angular velocities means that counter-clockwise rotations are positive, just like the usual angle direction convention. Did you know? Angular directions have long been considered to have magical or spiritual significance. In Britain the counterclockwise direction was once known as widdershins, and it was considered unlucky to travel around a church in a widdershins direction. Interestingly, right-handed people tend to naturally draw circles in a counterclockwise direction, and clockwise drawing in right-handed children is an early warning sign for the later development of schizophrenia [Blau, 1977].

Rotations and vector \u00e2\u0080\u009cpositions\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fact that vectors don't have positions means that vector rotations are independent of where vectors are drawn, just like for derivatives. animatereset Show: rigid arrangementfixed originsderivatives Rotational motion of vectors which are drawn moving about. Note that the drawn position does not affect the angular velocity $\\omega$ or the derivative vectors. Properties of rotations Rotations are rigid transformations, meaning that they keep constant all vector lengths and all relative vector angles. These facts are reflected in the following results, which all consider two vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) that are rotating with angular velocity \\( \\vec\\omega \\). Derivative of rotating vector is orthogonal. #rkr-e2a $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{a} = 0 $$  Using #rkr-el and the scalar triple product formula #rvi-es gives: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\cdot \\dot{\\vec{a}}&= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\big( \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a} \\big) \\\\&= \\vec{\\omega} \\cdot \\big( \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} \\big) \\\\&= 0.\\end{aligned} $$ Angle \\(\\theta\\) between rotating vectors is constant. #rkr-e2b $$ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\vec{b} \\cdot\\vec{a}}{b a}\\right) = \\text{constant} $$  We first consider the dot product \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\) and show that this is not changing with time. We do this by using the scalar triple product formula #rvi-es to find: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\frac{d}{dt} \\big( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\big)&= \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\dot{\\vec{b}} \\\\&= (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{b}) \\\\&= \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) + \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{\\omega}) \\\\&= \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) - \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) \\\\&= 0.\\end{aligned} $$ Now \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\) is constant and the lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constant, so the angle \\(\\theta\\) between the vectors must be constant. Rotating vectors parallel to \\(\\vec\\omega\\) are constant. #rkr-e2c $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} = 0 \\qquad \\text{if \\(\\vec{a}\\) is rotating and parallel to \\(\\vec\\omega\\)} $$  From #rkr-el we know that the derivative is $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} = \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec{a}, $$ but the cross product is zero for parallel vectors, so this the derivative is zero.

Then let \\( \\vec{v} = \\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{u} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{b} \\), so \\( \\hat{u}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{b} \\) is a right-handed orthonormal basis. Take \\(\\phi\\) to be the angle between \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\hat{b} \\).

To do this, we need to work out what \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v},\\hat{b} \\)are in terms of these other vectors. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{v} &= \\frac{\\hat{b} \\times\\vec{a}}{\\|\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}\\|} =\\frac{\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}}{a \\sin\\phi} \\\\\\hat{u} &= \\frac{\\vec{v} \\times\\hat{b}}{\\|\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{b}\\|} =\\frac{\\vec{v} \\times \\hat{b}}{a \\sin\\phi} =\\frac{(\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}) \\times \\hat{b}}{a\\sin\\phi} = \\frac{\\hat{b} \\times (\\vec{a} \\times\\hat{b})}{a \\sin\\phi} \\\\&= \\frac{\\vec{a} - (\\hat{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}) \\hat{b}}{a \\sin\\phi} = \\frac{1}{a\\sin\\phi} \\vec{a} - \\frac{\\hat{b} \\cdot\\vec{a}}{a \\sin\\phi} \\hat{b}.\\end{aligned} $$ Substituting these into the rotated vector expression above gives $$ \\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{Rot}(\\vec{a};\\theta,\\hat{b}) &= a\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi \\, \\left( \\frac{1}{a \\sin\\phi}\\vec{a} - \\frac{\\hat{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}}{a\\sin\\phi} \\hat{b} \\right) \\\\& \\qquad + a \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\, \\left(\\frac{\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}}{a \\sin\\phi} \\right)+ a \\cos\\phi \\,\\hat{b} \\\\ &= \\cos\\theta\\,\\vec{a} - \\cos\\theta \\,(\\hat{b} \\cdot\\vec{a}) \\,\\hat{b} + \\sin\\theta \\,(\\hat{b} \\times\\vec{a}) + a\\cos\\theta \\,\\hat{b} \\\\ &=\\cos\\theta \\,\\vec{a} + (1 - \\cos\\theta) (\\hat{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}) \\,\\hat{b} + \\sin\\theta \\,(\\hat{b}\\times \\vec{a}).\\end{aligned} $$ Angular acceleration In polar coordinates, acceleration consists of both radial and tangential components. The tangential component is directly related to changes in the angular velocity, which introduces the concept of angular acceleration. Angular acceleration, denoted as \\( \\ddot{\\theta} \\) represents the rate of change of angular velocity \\( \\dot{\\theta} \\) with respect to time. It appears as part of the total acceleration in the tangential direction, described by the unit vector \\( \\hat{e}_{\\theta} \\). The full expression for the acceleration in polar coordinates is: $$ \\vec{a} = (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2) \\hat{e}_r + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta}) \\hat{e}_\\theta $$ Here, the first term of the equation represents the radial component, described by the unit \\( \\hat{e}_r \\), and the second term is the angular component, described by the vector unit \\( \\hat{e}_{\\theta} \\). In the radial component, there is a radial (\\( \\ddot{r} \\)) and a centripetal (\\( r\\dot{\\theta}^2 \\)) term. In the angular component, there is an angular (\\( r\\ddot{\\theta} \\)) and a coriolis (\\( 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} \\)) term. Tangential and Normal basis Normal basis Consider a particle moving with position vector \\( \\vec{r} \\) and corresponding velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\) and acceleration \\( \\vec{a} \\). The tangential/normal basis \\( \\hat{e}_t,\\hat{e}_n,\\hat{e}_b \\) is: Tangential/normal basis vectors. #rkt-eb $$ \\begin{aligned}\\hat{e}_t &= \\hat{v}& &\\text{tangential basis vector} \\\\\\hat{e}_n &= \\frac{\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|}= \\frac{\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a},\\vec{v})}{\\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a},\\vec{v})\\|}& &\\text{normal basis vector} \\\\\\hat{e}_b &= \\hat{e}_t \\times \\hat{e}_n& &\\text{binormal basis vector} \\\\\\end{aligned} $$  These equations are definitions of the basis vectors, so the only thing to derive is the alternative formula for \\( \\hat{e}_n \\). Using the definition of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) above and #rvc-eu, we see that $$ \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t = \\dot{\\hat{v}} = \\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{v}}, \\vec{v}) = \\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v}). $$ Normalizing both sides gives the desired expression: $$ \\frac{\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})}{ \\left\\|\\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\right\\|} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})}{ \\frac{1}{v} \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\|} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})}{ \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\|}. $$ The tangential basis vector \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) points tangential to the path, the normal basis vector \\( \\hat{e}_n \\) points perpendicular (normal) to the path towards the instantaneous center of curvature, and the binormal basis vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\) completes the right-handed basis. animateresetshow labelsShow:position vectorvelocityaccelerationacceleration decompositioncenter of curvatureosculating circleang. vel.ang. vel. decomposition Tangential/normal basis associated with movement around a curve in 3D.

The center of curvature and osculating circle are defined below. Curvature and torsion Curvature and torsion. #rkt-ek To better understand the geometry of the tangential/normal basis, we can use the curvature \\(\\kappa\\) to describe the curving of the path, and the torsion \\(\\tau\\) to describe the rotation of the basis about the path. These quantities are defined by: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\kappa &= \\frac{d\\hat{e}_t}{ds} \\cdot \\hat{e}_n= \\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\cdot \\hat{e}_n & &\\text{curvature} \\\\\\rho &= \\frac{1}{\\kappa} & &\\text{radius of curvature} \\\\\\tau &= -\\frac{d\\hat{e}_b}{ds} \\cdot \\hat{e}_n= -\\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_b \\cdot \\hat{e}_n & &\\text{torsion} \\\\\\sigma &= \\frac{1}{\\tau} & &\\text{radius of torsion}\\end{aligned} $$  These equations are definitions, so we need only check that the two expressions for each of \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\tau\\) are equivalent. This follows immediately, however, from the chain-rule conversions #rkt-ea between \\(d/ds\\) and \\(d/dt\\). The radius of curvature \\(\\rho\\) is the radius of equivalent circular motion, and the torsion determines the rate of rotation of the osculating plane, as described below in a section below. Basis derivatives and angular velocity As the point \\(P\\) moves along its path, the associated tangential/normal basis rotates with an angular velocity vector \\(\\omega\\) given by: Angular velocity of the tangential/normal basis. #rkt-ew $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{\\omega} &= v\\tau \\,\\hat{e}_t + v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_b\\end{aligned} $$  We start by writing the angular velocity in the tangential/normal basis, giving: $$ \\vec{\\omega} = \\omega_t\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_n+ \\omega_b\\,\\hat{e}_b. $$ Now the basis vector derivatives are given by the cross product by \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) from #rkr-ew, so we can evaluate the expressions #rkt-ek for curvature and torsion to give: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\kappa &= \\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_t) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} (\\omega_b\\,\\hat{e}_n - \\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} \\omega_b\\end{aligned} $$ and $$ \\begin{aligned}\\tau &= -\\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_b \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= -\\frac{1}{v} (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_b) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= -\\frac{1}{v} (\\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_t - \\omega_t\\,\\hat{e}_n) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} \\omega_t.\\end{aligned} $$ Rearranging the final expressions in each case gives \\( \\omega_b = v\\kappa \\) and \\( \\omega_t = v\\tau \\). From the definition #rkt-eb of \\( \\hat{e}_n \\), we see that $$ \\begin{aligned}\\hat{e}_n &= \\frac{\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} \\\\\\hat{e}_n \\cdot \\hat{e}_b &= \\frac{1}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_t) \\cdot \\hat{e}_b \\\\0 &= \\frac{1}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} (\\omega_b\\,\\hat{e}_n - \\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\cdot \\hat{e}_b \\\\&= - \\frac{1}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} \\omega_n.\\end{aligned} $$ from which we conclude that \\( \\omega_n = 0 \\), giving us all three components of \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\).

The equations #rkt-ed for the basis derivatives are often called the Frenet-Serret formulas, typically written in terms of \\(s\\) derivatives: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\frac{d\\hat{e}_t}{ds} &= \\phantom{-\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t - } \\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\\\frac{d\\hat{e}_n}{ds} &= -\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t \\phantom{ - \\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_n + } + \\tau\\,\\hat{e}_b \\\\\\frac{d\\hat{e}_b}{ds} &=\\phantom{-\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t } - \\tau\\,\\hat{e}_n.\\end{aligned} $$ If we divide the angular velocity vector #rkt-ew by \\(v\\) then we obtain the vector $$ \\frac{1}{v} \\vec{\\omega} = \\tau\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_b, $$ which is known as the Darboux vector after its discoverer, Jean Gaston Darboux. Normal and Tangential kinematics While the motion of a point \\(P\\) along a path defines the tangential/normal basis, we can also use this basis to express the kinematics of \\(P\\) itself, giving the following expressions for velocity and acceleration. Velocity and acceleration in tangential/normal basis. #rkt-e $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v} &= \\dot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t \\\\\\vec{a} &= \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t + \\frac{\\dot{s}^2}{\\rho} \\hat{e}_n\\end{aligned} $$  From the definition #rkt-eb of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) we see that \\( v\\,\\hat{e}_t = v\\hat{v} = \\vec{v} \\), which is the first equation above. Differentiating this and using \\( v = \\dot{s} \\) from #rkt-es gives $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v} &= \\dot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\\\vec{a} = \\dot{\\vec{v}}&= \\ddot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\dot{s}\\,\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\\\&= \\ddot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\dot{s}(v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_n) \\\\&= \\ddot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\frac{\\dot{s}^2}{\\rho} \\,\\hat{e}_n,\\end{aligned} $$ where we used the derivative #rkt-ed of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) in terms of the curvature \\(\\kappa\\), and the definition #rkt-ek of the radius of curvature to give \\( \\kappa = 1/\\rho \\). The above formula shows that the normal acceleration component \\(a_n\\) is determined by the radius of curvature. We can therefore also find the radius of curvature from knowing the normal acceleration: Radius of curvature \\(\\rho\\) for velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) and acceleration \\(\\vec{a}\\) with angle \\(\\theta\\) between them. #rkt-er $$ \\rho = \\frac{v^2}{a_n} = \\frac{v^2}{|a\\sin\\theta|} $$  From #rkt-ev we known that the normal component of the acceleration is given by \\( a_n =\\dot{s}^2/\\rho \\) and from the definition #rkt-es of path length we have \\( \\dot{s} = v \\), so this equation can be rearranged to give \\( \\rho = v^2 / a_n \\). Now because \\( \\vec{a} \\) only has \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) and \\( \\hat{e}_n \\) components, the \\( \\hat{e}_n \\) component is given by $$ \\begin{aligned}a_n &= \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\hat{e}_t)\\| \\\\&= \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\| \\\\&= |a \\sin\\theta|,\\end{aligned} $$ where we used the facts that \\( \\vec{e}_t \\) is in the direction of \\( \\vec{v} \\), that \\( \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a},\\vec{v}) \\) does not depend on the magnitude of \\( \\vec{v} \\), and equation #rvv-em for the magnitude of the complementary projection. animateresetshow labelsMovement: circle var-circle ellipse arc trefoil eight comet pendulumShow:position vectorvelocityaccelerationacceleration decompositionpathcenter of curvatureosculating circleangular velocityOrigin: \\(O_1\\) \\(O_2\\) Velocity and acceleration in the tangential/normal basis.

Tangent lines and osculating circles Given a point \\(P\\) moving along a complex path, at a given instant of time we can match different components of the point's motion with successively more complex geometric shapes: matchgeometric objectname\\( \\vec{r} \\)pointposition\\( \\vec{r},\\vec{v} \\)linetangent line\\( \\vec{r},\\vec{v},\\vec{a} \\)circleosculating circle The osculating circle is the instantaneous equivalent circular path. That is, a particle traveling on the osculating circle with the same location \\(P\\), speed \\( \\dot{s} \\), and tangential acceleration \\( \\ddot{s} \\) as our particle would have matching velocity and acceleration vectors. Osculating circle #rkt-eo $$ \\text{center C} = \\vec{r} + \\rho \\hat{e}_n,\\qquad \\text{radius} \\; \\rho,\\qquad \\text{normal} \\; \\hat{e}_b $$  Consider a particle \\(P\\) with position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) moving with velocity \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) and acceleration \\( \\vec{a}_P \\) , and let \\( \\hat{e}_t,\\hat{e}_n,\\hat{e}_b \\)be the associated tangential/normal basis and \\( \\rho_P \\) be the radius of curvature. Set \\( \\dot{s}_P = v_P \\)and \\( \\ddot{s}_P = \\vec{a}_P \\cdot \\hat{e}_t \\) to be the speed and tangential acceleration of \\(P\\). Next define the osculating circle as above with center \\( C = \\vec{r}_P + \\rho_P \\) , radius \\( \\rho_P \\), and normal vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\). Now take a second particle \\(Q\\) moving on the osculating circle so that its instantaneous position matches \\(P\\) and it has the same speed \\( \\dot{s}_Q = \\dot{s}_P \\) and tangential acceleration \\( \\ddot{s}_Q = \\ddot{s}_P \\). This means that the radius of the circle \\( r_Q \\) for \\(Q\\) is matches the osculating circle radius \\( \\rho_P \\), so \\( r_Q = \\rho_P \\). We want to prove that \\( \\vec{v}_Q = \\vec{v}_P \\) and \\( \\vec{a}_Q = \\vec{a}_P \\). We will use a polar coordinate system for \\(Q\\), centered at \\(C\\) and in the plane with normal vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\). At the current instant when the particles are at the same position, this means that \\( \\hat{e}_r = -\\hat{e}_n \\) and \\( \\hat{e}_\\theta = \\hat{e}_t \\). Using the circular motion expressions #rke-ec we have that the velocity of \\(Q\\) is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= v_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= \\dot{s}_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= \\dot{s}_P \\,\\hat{e}_t = \\vec{v}_P. \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ For a particle moving in a circle like \\(Q\\), the speed is given by \\( \\dot{s}_Q = v_Q = r_Q \\omega_Q \\), and differentiating this gives \\( \\ddot{s}_Q = r_Q \\dot{\\omega}_Q = r_Q \\alpha_Q \\). Using this, the acceleration of \\(Q\\) is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_Q &= -\\frac{v_Q^2}{\\rho_Q} \\,\\hat{e}_r + \\rho_Q \\alpha_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= -\\frac{\\dot{s}_Q^2}{\\rho_Q} \\,\\hat{e}_r + \\ddot{s}_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= \\frac{\\dot{s}_P^2}{\\rho_P} \\,\\hat{e}_n + \\ddot{s}_Q \\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_Q. \\end{aligned} $$ We thus see that points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have the same instantaneous velocity and acceleration. This also means that the tangential/normal basis computed at this instant for \\(Q\\) will match that of \\(P\\). The osculating circle lies in the \\( \\hat{e}_t,\\hat{e}_n \\) plane, which is thus called the osculating plane. This plane has normal vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\), and rotates about \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) with a rotation rate determined by the torsion \\(\\tau\\), as we see from the expression #rkt-ed for the derivative of \\( \\hat{e}_b. \\) animateresetshow labelsShow:position vectorvelocityaccelerationacceleration decompositiontangent lineosculating circleMatch phase:0% Tangent lines and osculating circles, showing matching of velocity or velocity and acceleration, respectively. Curvature on curves Given a parametric curve, its curvature can be directly evaluated with: Curvature of parametric curve \\(\\vec{r}(u)\\) in 3D. #rkt-ec $$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\|\\vec{r}' \\times \\vec{r}''\\|}{\\|\\vec{r}'\\|^3} $$  Because the tangential/normal basis vectors #rkt-eb are all normalized, it does not matter how fast the point moves along the line. We can thus evaluate the parametric curve as a function of time, giving \\( \\vec{r}(t) \\). Now: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\|\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'\\| &= \\|\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{v}\\| \\\\&= a v \\sin\\theta \\\\&= \\frac{v^3}{\\rho},\\end{aligned} $$ where we used the cross product length formula #rvv-el and equation #rkt-er for the radius of curvature \\( \\rho \\). By definition #rkt-ek the curvature is \\( \\kappa = 1/\\rho \\), so $$ \\begin{aligned}\\|\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'\\|&= v^3 \\kappa \\\\\\kappa &= \\frac{\\|\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'\\|}{\\|\\vec{r}'\\|^3}.\\end{aligned} $$ While the above formula can be used in 2D by taking the third component to be zero, it can also be written in an explicitly 2D form: Curvature of parametric curve \\(x = x(u)\\), \\(y = y(u)\\) in 2D. #rkt-e2 $$ \\kappa = \\frac{|x''y' - y''x'|}{(x'^2 + y'^2)^{3/2}} $$  This equation is just #rkt-ec written in explicit 2D coordinates. To see this, we first take the position vector \\( \\vec{r}(u) \\) to be $$ \\vec{r}(u) = x(u)\\,\\hat\\imath + y(u)\\,\\hat\\jmath. $$ Now \\( r'(u) = \\sqrt{(x'(u))^2 + (y'(u))^2} \\) and $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'&= (x''\\,\\hat\\imath + y''\\,\\hat\\jmath)\\times (x'\\,\\hat\\imath + y'\\,\\hat\\jmath) \\\\&= (x''y' - y''x')\\,\\hat{k},\\end{aligned} $$ so evaluating #rkt-ec gives the desired expression. We can take this a step further, and obtain an expression for an explicitly defined function. Curvature of an explicitly defined function \\(y = f(x).\\) #rkt-e3 $$ \\kappa = \\frac{|y''(x)|}{(1 + y'(x)^2)^{3/2}} $$  Use equation #rkt\u00e2\u0080\u0091e2 and parametrize the curve using \\(x\\) as the parametrization variable. Namely: $$ \\begin{aligned}x = u, \\quad \\quad y = y(u) = y(x)\\end{aligned} $$ This yields a very elegant expression, as \\( x'(u) = 1 \\) and \\( x''(u) = 0 \\), which lets us arrive at the desired expression #rkt\u00e2\u0080\u0091e3.

But how valid is this assumption? We will consider motion due to: Spinning of the Earth about the North-South axis. Orbit of the Earth about the Sun. Rotation of the Sun around center the Milky Way. Motion of the Milky Way through the universe. As we will see below, some of these velocities are not small. Why is normally valid to assume that we are in an inertial reference frame? Reference material Elementary motions Concepts applied Angular velocity Angular acceleration Periods of rotation The different types of motion have magnitudes roughly given in the following table.

The first people to have a rough idea of the radius of the Earth and the distance to the Sun were the ancient Greeks. Eratosthenes (276\u00e2\u0080\u0093195 BCE) computed the radius of the Earth to be 40\u00e2\u0080\u0089000 stadia (6800\u00c2\u00a0km) by measuring the difference in Sun angle between Aswan and Alexandria. Aristarchus of Samos (310\u00e2\u0080\u0093230 BCE) obtained the first estimates of the distance to the Sun by using observations of lunar eclipses and solar parallax. While his method was in principle correct, poor observational data meant that his computed Earth-Sun distance was quite inaccurate. Solar and sidereal time We all know that one day is 24 hours long. But the period of the Earth's rotation is not 24 hours! This is because of the difference between solar time and sidereal time. Solar time is the time measured against the Sun, as we normally do. Sidereal time is measured against the stars, which is slightly different. animatereset Schematic of the Earth's rotation about its own axis and about the sun, counting solar days and sidereal days. Here the Earth has just 8 solar days per year for better visualization. As we can see above, the Earth rotates one more sidereal day each year than solar days. This means: $$ \\text{1 solar year} = \\text{365 solar days}= \\text{366 sidereal days} $$ and so: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\text{sidereal day} &= \\frac{365}{366}\\ \\text{solar day} \\\\&= \\frac{365}{366} \\times 24\\ {\\rm h} \\\\&= 23.93{\\rm\\ h} \\\\&= 23{\\rm\\ h}\\ 56{\\rm\\ min}\\end{aligned} $$ The Earth's orbital angular velocity is thus actually \\( \\omega = 360^\\circ / (23.93{\\rm\\ h}) = 15.04^\\circ/\\rm h \\). The relationship between solar and sidereal days can also be computed by considering just a single day, as shown below. Diagram of one solar day and one sidereal day for the Earth, not drawn to scale. The fact that \\( \\omega_{\\rm E} \\) and \\( \\omega_{\\rm S} \\) are in the same direction means that sidereal days are shorter than solar days (this is not a coincidence). Just as for the definition of a day, there is a similar distinction between the synodic lunar month, which is the time between passes of the Moon between the Earth and the Sun, and the sidereal lunar month, which is the orbital period of the Moon in an inertial frame. In common usage, the phrase lunar month refers to the synodic month. Did you know? Just as sidereal days and solar days are different, the exact length of one year depends on how we define it. The sidereal year is the time for the Earth to complete one orbit relative to the fixed stars, and has length 365.256363 solar days. The tropical year is the time for the Earth to return to the same point in the seasons, which varies around a value of about 365.242189 solar days (about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year). These years are different because of the axial precession of the Earth. In common usage the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cyear\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to the tropical year, as the seasons have historically been more important for people than the motion of the stars. Observe that: $$ 365.242 \\approx 365 + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{400} $$ This is why leap years in our Gregorian calendar add an extra day every 4 years, unless the year is a whole century, except every 400 years. If our calendar used sidereal years instead of tropical, the fact that 365.256363 is slightly larger than 365.25 would mean that about every 200 years we would need to have a double leap year, when there would be two extra days (February 30?). While leap years occur because the year is not an exact integer number of days, a similar problem is caused by the fact that the solar day is not exactly 24 \u00c3\u0097 60 \u00c3\u0097 60 seconds. The length of the day actually varies somewhat unpredictably due to tidal friction as well as climactic and geologic events such as glacier formation and mass redistribution in the mantle, both of which change the Earth's moment of inertia. To correct for these variations a leap second is occasionally added, in which the last minute of the day has 61 seconds. Track transition curves Insert this hole section here. For passengers in a car or train, traveling in a straight line at constant speed is the most comfortable motion, as there is no acceleration. Roads or rail lines with only straight lines are rather limiting, however, so we frequently encounter curves, in the most extreme form in large freeway interchanges such as shown below. When designing a freeway interchange, one of the most basic questions just what shape the transition curves between the straight-line roads should have. Other considerations then follow, such as stacking the roads above each other and banking the angle of the roads. The difficultly in designing curves in roads arises from the need to have a smooth ride for the passengers in the vehicles as they traverse the curves at high speed. In particular, we do not want to have sudden changes in acceleration for the passengers.

Reference material Position, velocity, and accelerationTangential/normal coordinates Circular arcs for transition curves To understand the issues with transition curve design, we will consider a simple oval track with two straight segments joined by curves at both ends. The simplest curve shapes are semi-circles (half-circles), as shown below. animate Car driving at constant speed around a track with straight line segments joined to perfect semi-circle ends. The graph at the bottom shows the acceleration magnitude versus time. Note the sudden jump in acceleration magnitude when the car switches from a straight line to the curve. If we animate the car driving around the track with semi-circle ends, then we see that there is zero acceleration on the straight segments, but on the semi-circular transition curves the acceleration is inwards with magnitude \\( v^2 / \\rho \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the radius of curvature. A passenger would thus feel no acceleration on the straight segments, but then would suddenly feel a large sideways acceleration as the vehicle switches to the semi-circles, which would be very uncomfortable and potentially dangerous. For passenger comfort, we do not want rapid changes in acceleration for transition curves. That is, we want a low value for the derivative of acceleration with respect to time. The derivative of acceleration is known as jerk, defined by \\( \\vec{\\jmath} = \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) (for vectors) or \\( j = \\dot{a} \\) (for scalars). With perfect semi-circular ends we see that the jerk is mathematically infinite at the transition to the curve, although in reality it would just be a very high value as the vehicle would not transition to the semi-circle instantaneously. Reference material While the terms velocity and acceleration are standard for the 1st and 2nd derivatives of position, the names for higher derivatives are not so well-established. While jerk is often used for the derivative of acceleration (so the 3rd derivative of position), the terms jolt, surge, and lurch are also sometimes encountered for this quantity. The derivative of jerk is sometimes called jounce (so it is the 4th derivative of position). Another suggestion is to refer to the 4th, 5th, and 6th derivatives of position as snap, crackle, and pop, respectively. Jerk and snap have many applications in engineering and science. For example, jerk and snap have both been used to measure human movement smoothness and diagnose stroke patients (Rohrer et al., 2002) while minimizing snap is often used as a design principle for quadcopter control schemes (Mellinger and Kumar, 2011). Changing accelerations (causing jerk) must result from changing forces, due to Newton's second law. Although the terminology is also somewhat loose in this case, the derivative of force with respect to time is often referred to as yank, and the derivative of yank is called tug (the second derivative of force). Third derivatives and higher of force are very rarely encountered, and do not seem to have any names in common usage. References D. Mellinger and V.

Smooth transition curves with Euler spirals Unlike the sudden switch shown above from a straight line segment (no curvature) to a curved transition curve, we would prefer to have a more gradual transition. An example of this is shown below with the right-hand transition curves changed to use Euler spiral segments, which start curving gradually and then increase the curvature the further the vehicle moves around the curve, before reversing the process on the second half of the curve. Euler spirals are one of the common types of track transition curves and are special because the curvature varies linearly along the curve. animate Car driving at constant speed around a track with perfect straight line segments joined to Euler-spiral segments on the right-hand curve and a semi-circle on the left-hand curve. The red curve is a perfect semi-circle for comparison. Note the continuous transition in acceleration when the car switches from a straight line to the left-hand curve. If we animate the motion around the track with Euler spiral transitions, then we can see from the acceleration magnitude plot that the acceleration does not suddenly jump as the vehicle moves around the right-hand curve. Instead it steadily increases to a maximum value, before decreasing again to zero. The peak acceleration needed on the Euler spiral transitions is somewhat higher than on the semi-circle transitions, but we have avoided the sudden jerk associated with switching from straight line to circular motion. Reference material The equation for a spiral with linear curvature variation was first derived by the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler in 1744, hence the name Euler spiral for this curve. The spiral was then independently rediscovered in the late 1800s by civil engineers who were unaware of Euler's work and who named the resulting spiral the clothoid, which is still a commonly used name in traffic engineering. This spiral also arises in the study of near-field diffraction in optics, as developed by the French engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel and the French physicist Alfred Cornu, for which reason the spiral is also sometimes called the Cornu spiral. Euler spiral equation An Euler spiral is a curve for which the acceleration magnitude increases at a constant rate as we travel along the curve at uniform velocity. Another way to say this is that the curvature is a linear function of the distance along the curve. To see that this is the same thing, we write the acceleration in a tangential/normal basis as For $$ \\vec{a} = \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t + \\kappa v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n. $$ constant-speed motion with speed \\(v\\), the distance along the curve satisfies \\( \\dot{s} = v = \\text{constant} \\), so \\( \\ddot{s} = 0 \\). The acceleration vector thus only has a normal component, and this has magnitude proportional to the curvature \\( \\kappa = 1/\\rho \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the radius of curvature. To have the acceleration increasing linearly along the curve, we thus want the curvature to be a linear function of distance, so \\( \\kappa = \\alpha s \\) for some constant \\( \\alpha \\). While specifying that \\( \\kappa = \\alpha s \\) is enough to define the shape of the Euler spiral curve, finding the explicit equation for the curve is not so easy. We first introduce the functions \\(C(z)\\) and \\(S(z)\\), known as Fresnel integrals and defined by: Fresnel integrals #avt-ef $$ \\begin{aligned}C(z) &= \\int_0^z \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) du \\\\S(z) &= \\int_0^z \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) du\\end{aligned} $$ The Fresnel integrals do not have any simpler forms in terms of elementary functions, as the integrals in them cannot be computed in closed form. Now we define the constant \\( \\ell = \\sqrt{\\pi/\\alpha} \\), and then the position at distance \\(s\\) along an Euler spiral curve is: Euler spiral #avt-ee $$ \\vec{r} = \\ell C(s / \\ell) \\, \\hat{\\imath}+ \\ell S(s / \\ell) \\, \\hat{\\jmath} $$  We start the spiral curve from the origin, initially moving horizontally to the right and curving upwards with constant speed \\(v\\). Using a tangential/normal basis, let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) as shown. Then \\( \\dot{\\theta} \\) can be found by considering two expressions for the acceleration. First, from the tangential/normal acceleration formula, we have $$ \\vec{a} = \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t + \\kappa v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n = \\alpha s v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n, $$ where we used the fact that \\( \\ddot{s} = \\dot{v} = 0 \\) (constant speed) and that \\( \\kappa = \\alpha s \\) for some constant \\(\\alpha\\) (the definition of the Euler spiral is that curvature is a linear function of distance \\(s\\)). The second expression for acceleration uses the angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{k} \\) of the tangential/normal basis vectors. Recalling that \\( \\vec{v} = v \\, \\hat{e}_t \\) and \\(v\\) is constant, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = \\dot{\\vec{v}} = v \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t = v \\, \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{e}_t = v \\dot{\\theta} \\, \\hat{e}_n. \\end{aligned} $$ Comparing the two expressions for \\( \\vec{a} \\) and using \\( s = vt \\) we see that $$ \\dot{\\theta} = \\alpha s v = \\alpha v^2 t $$ and we can integrate this (with the initial condition that $\\(\\theta\\) starts at zero) to give $$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 t^2. $$ To find the equation for \\( \\vec{r} \\) we can integrate the equation $$ \\dot{\\vec{r}} = v \\, \\hat{e}_t = v \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{\\imath} + v \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{\\jmath} $$ starting from \\( \\vec{r}=0 \\) to obtain $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r} &= \\int_0^t \\left(v \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 \\tau^2\\Big) \\, \\hat{\\imath} + v \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 \\tau^2 \\Big) \\, \\hat{\\jmath}\\right) d\\tau \\\\ &= \\ell \\int_0^{s/\\ell} \\left( \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) \\, \\hat{\\imath} + \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) \\, \\hat{\\jmath} \\right) du, \\end{aligned} $$ where we made the substitution \\( \\tau = \\ell u / v \\) with \\( \\ell = \\sqrt{\\pi/\\alpha} \\). Using the definitions of the Fresnel integrals now gives the desired expression. Plotting the Euler spiral equation gives the curve below, which starts out at the origin with zero curvature, and the then has steadily increasing curvature as we move along it. Euler spiral shape defined by the equation above. Changing the value of \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\ell\\) simply scales the whole curve to make it bigger or smaller, without changing the shape. The full Euler spiral is unsuitable for track transitions, as the curvature increases without limit. Instead, we can piece together short segments of the Euler spiral to form our transition curve. For example, the right-hand curve in the smooth track above is composed of two copies of the first quarter-turn of the Euler spiral, with one copy flipped upside down. This means the curvature starts at zero, increases linearly to a maximum halfway around the curve, then decreases linearly again back to zero to join the straight segment.

    "text": "Rigid Body Kinematics Rigid bodies A rigid body is an extended area of material that includes all the points inside it, and which moves so that the distances and angles between all its points remain constant. The location of a rigid body can be described by the position of one point \\(P\\) inside it, together with the rotation angle of the body (one angle in 2D, three angles in 3D). location descriptionvelocity descriptionpoint massposition vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\)velocity vector \\( \\vec{v}_P \\)rigid body in 2D position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) angle \\(\\theta\\) velocity vector \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) angular velocity \\( \\omega \\)rigid body in 3D position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) angles \\( \\theta,\\phi,\\psi \\) velocity vector \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) angular velocity vector \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) Neither point masses nor rigid bodies can physically exist, as no body can really be a single point with no extent, and no extended body can be exactly rigid. Despite this, these are very useful models for mechanics and dynamics. Rotating rigid bodies All points on a rigid body have the same angular rotation angles, as we can see on the figure below. Because the angular velocity is the derivative of the rotation angles, this means that every point on a rigid body has the same angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\), and also the same angular acceleration \\( \\vec{\\alpha} \\). In 2D the angle \\( \\theta \\) of a rigid body the angle of rotation from a fixed reference (typically the \\( \\hat\\imath \\) direction), measured positive counter-clockwise. The angular velocity is \\( \\omega = \\dot\\theta \\) and the angular acceleration is \\( \\alpha = \\dot\\omega = \\ddot\\theta \\). The vector versions of these are \\( \\vec\\omega = \\omega \\, \\hat{k} \\) and \\( \\vec\\alpha = \\alpha\\,\\hat{k} \\), where \\( \\hat{k} \\) is the out-of-plane direction. animationreset Show: anglesangular velocities All points on a rigid body rotate at the same rate. Body \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) is rotated by angle \\(\\theta_1\\), so its angular velocity is \\( \\omega_1 = \\dot{\\theta}_1 \\), and similarly for the second body. + Warning: Labeling angular quantities on rigid bodies. #rkg-ww Angular quantities (\\( \\theta , \\omega , \\alpha \\))for rigid bodies should not be labeled with points. If P and Q are points on a rigid body, we do not write \\( \\omega_P \\) or \\( \\omega_Q \\) for the angular velocity about these points. Instead, we label angular quantities according to the body. If we have two rigid bodies \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\), then \\( \\omega_1 \\) is the angular velocity of the first body (and all points on it) and \\( \\omega_2 \\) is the angular velocity of the second body. Did you know? Rotations in 3D are significantly more complicated than rotations in 2D. Unlike positions, velocities, etc, which simply go from 2D vectors to 3D vectors, rotational quantities go from scalars in 2D to full 3D vectors in 3D. Angular velocity and angular acceleration are somewhat straightforward, so equations #rkg-er hold in both 2D and 3D, but understanding the rotations themselves is significantly more complicated. There are three main ways that 3D rotations can be represented: Euler angles Rotation matrices Quaternions Detailed study of rotations in 3D is necessary for a full understanding of topics ranging from satellite attitude control to articulated robot construction, and is usually covered in advanced dynamics courses. Points on rigid bodies Copy content from here If we know how one point \\(P\\) on a rigid body is moving and we also know how the body is rotating, then we can calculate the movement of any other point \\(Q\\) on the same body. The formulas for this are given below. Rigid body point relations. #rkg-er $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{r}_Q &= \\vec{r}_P + \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\\\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P+ \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\\\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P+ \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}+ \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ})\\end{aligned} $$ Points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are two locations on a rigid body. Vectors \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) and \\( \\vec{\\alpha} \\) are the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the rigid body.  The first equation is simply the definition of the offset vector \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\). Differentiating the first equation gives $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_Q &= \\vec{r}_P + \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ \\dot{\\vec{r}}_Q &= \\dot{\\vec{r}}_P + \\dot{\\vec{r}}_{PQ} \\\\ \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}, \\end{aligned} $$ where the derivative of \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) comes from the rotation formula, given that this offset vector is simply rotating with the rigid body. If we differentiate again then we obtain $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ \\dot{\\vec{v}}_Q &= \\dot{\\vec{v}}_P + \\dot{\\vec{\\omega}} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\dot{\\vec{r}}_{PQ} \\\\ \\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}), \\end{aligned} $$ where we use the fact that \\( \\vec{\\alpha} = \\dot{\\vec{\\omega}} \\). + Warning: Cross product order #rkg-wc Because cross products are not associative, it is very important to compute the centripetal acceleration term with the parentheses as shown. That is, we must not compute \\( (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{\\omega}) \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\), as this is always zero. The term \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\) in the acceleration equation above is called the centripetal (center-seeking) term, as it is always in the direction \\( -\\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) and so acts from \\(Q\\) towards the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccenter\u00e2\u0080\u009d \\(P\\).

The block is rotating clockwise and just before point \\(Q\\) hits the ground the angular velocity is \\(2\\rm\\ rad/s\\) clockwise and the angular acceleration is \\(3\\rm\\ rad/s^2\\) clockwise. What is the velocity and acceleration of \\(Q\\) just before impact?  Using the regular \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) basis, the known information just before impact is $$ \\vec{r}_{PQ} = 2\\,\\hat\\imath \\qquad \\vec{v}_P = -3\\,\\hat\\imath \\qquad \\vec{a}_P = 0 \\qquad \\vec\\omega = -2\\,\\hat{k} \\qquad \\vec\\alpha = -3\\,\\hat{k}. $$ The velocity and acceleration of \\(Q\\) are given by $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= -3\\,\\hat\\imath - 2\\,\\hat{k} \\times 2\\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ &= -3\\,\\hat\\imath - 4\\,\\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\\\ &= 0 - 3\\,\\hat{k} \\times 2\\,\\hat\\imath - 2\\,\\hat{k} \\times (-2\\,\\hat{k} \\times 2\\,\\hat\\imath) \\\\ &= -6\\,\\hat\\jmath - 2\\,\\hat{k} \\times (-4\\,\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= -8\\,\\hat\\imath - 6\\,\\hat\\jmath. \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Coupled rigid bodies #rkg-xc Three rigid bodies (two rods and a block) are coupled by pins at $O$, \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\) as shown. Body \\( \\mathcal{B}_3 \\) cannot rotate and must slide horizontally along the ground. The rod lengths are \\( OP = 3\\sqrt{2}\\rm\\ m \\) and \\( PQ = 5\\rm\\ m \\), and points $O$ and \\(Q\\) are the same height above the ground. At the instant shown, \\( \\theta_1 = 45^\\circ \\), \\( \\omega_1 = 4\\rm\\ rad/s \\) . What are \\( \\omega_2 \\) and \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) at this instant?  Taking a regular \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) basis at $O$, we can use the rod lengths and angles to find the relative position vectors: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_{OP} &= 3\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath\\rm\\ m \\\\ \\vec{r}_{PQ} &= 4\\hat\\imath - 3\\hat\\jmath\\rm\\ m. \\end{aligned} $$ Using the vector angular velocities \\( \\vec{\\omega}_1 = \\omega_1\\,\\hat{k} \\) and \\( \\vec{\\omega}_2 = \\omega_2\\,\\hat{k} \\), we can now use #rkg-er to find first \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) and then \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) in terms of the unknown angular velocity $\\omega_2$: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_{P} &= \\vec{v}_O + \\vec{\\omega}_1 \\times \\vec{r}_{OP} \\\\ &= 4\\hat{k} \\times (3\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= -12\\hat\\imath + 12\\hat\\jmath{\\rm\\ m/s} \\\\ \\vec{v}_{Q} &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega}_2 \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= (-12\\hat\\imath + 12\\hat\\jmath{\\rm\\ m/s}) + \\omega_2\\,\\hat{k} \\times (4\\hat\\imath - 3\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= (-12 + 3\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\imath + (12 + 4\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\jmath{\\rm\\ m/s}. \\end{aligned} $$ The last piece of information that we need to use is the constraint on the motion of \\( \\mathcal{B}_3 \\), namely that it can only slide horizontally. This can be expressed by saying that the vertical component of \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) is zero, or more generally that the component in the normal direction \\( \\hat{e}_n = \\hat\\jmath \\) is zero. That is: $$ \\begin{aligned} 0 &= \\vec{v}_Q \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= \\Big((-12 + 3\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\imath + (12 + 4\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\jmath\\Big) \\cdot \\hat\\jmath \\\\ &= 12 + 4\\omega_2 \\\\ \\omega_2 &= -3{\\rm\\ rad/s}. \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting this back into the expression above for \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) gives: $$ \\vec{v}_Q = -21\\hat\\imath{\\rm\\ m/s}, $$ which does indeed have no vertical component, as expected. + Warning: Rigid body points may be accelerating even if \\(\\vec{a}_P = 0\\) and \\(\\alpha = 0\\). #rkg-wa If \\( \\vec{\\alpha} = 0 \\) and \\( \\vec{a}_P = 0 \\) for a rigid body then we would normally say that the body itself is not accelerating. This does not mean, however, that the points on the bodies are not accelerating. If the body is rotating (so \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\ne 0 \\)) then the centripetal acceleration means that in fact most points on the body are accelerating at any time. Rigid bodies in 2D Copy content from here The #rkg-er equations above are valid in both 2D and 3D. If we know that we are in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane then the angular velocity vector is orthogonal to the plane in the \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction and the equations can be written in a simpler form with the perpendicular vector notation #rvv-en, as shown below. Rigid body point relations in 2D. #rkg-e2 $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{r}_Q &= \\vec{r}_P + \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\\\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P+ \\omega_z \\, \\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp \\\\\\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P+ \\alpha_z \\, \\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp- \\omega^2 \\, \\vec{r}_{PQ}\\end{aligned} $$ Points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are two locations on a rigid body. Scalars \\( \\omega_z \\) and \\( \\alpha_z \\) are the scalar angular velocity and angular acceleration of the rigid body (positive counter-clockwise).  The position vectors \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) and \\( \\vec{r}_Q \\) lie in the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane, so \\( \\vec{v}_P \\), \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\), and \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) are also in this plane. The angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors are orthogonal and thus can be written: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{\\omega} &= \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\\\ \\vec{\\alpha} &= \\alpha\\,\\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ Evaluating #rkg-er and using the cross-product expression #rvv-e9 now gives the velocity expression: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{v}_P + \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{v}_P + \\omega \\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp, \\end{aligned} $$ and the acceleration equation: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times (\\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp + \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times (\\omega\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp) \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp + \\omega^2 (\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp)^\\perp \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp - \\omega^2 \\vec{r}_{PQ}, \\end{aligned} $$ where we used the fact that \\( \\vec{r}^{\\perp\\perp} = -\\vec{r} \\) (two \\( 90^\\circ \\) rotations make a \\( 180^\\circ \\) rotation). If a point \\(M\\) on a rigid body has zero velocity then it is called the instantaneous center of rotation, because the velocity of all points on the body will be given by simple rotation about \\(M\\) with the angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) of the body. In 2D we can always find the instantaneous center with the following equation, although it might be outside of the physical body. Instantaneous center of rotation \\(M\\) in 2D. #rkg-ei $$ \\vec{r}_{PM} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P = \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\vec{v}_P^\\perp $$ Point \\(P\\) has velocity \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) and is attached to a rigid body rotating with angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\).  The instantaneous center \\(M\\) has the property that the point on the rigid body at \\(M\\) has zero velocity. We thus want: $$ 0 = \\vec{v}_M = \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM}. $$ Taking another cross product by \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} 0 &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\Big( \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM}) \\\\ &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P - \\omega^2 \\, \\vec{r}_{PM} \\text{ (because \\vec\\omega \\perp \\vec{r}_{PM})} \\\\ \\vec{r}_{PM} &= \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P. \\end{aligned} $$ Here we used the fact that if \\( \\vec{r}_{PM} \\). lies in the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane and \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) is in the \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction, then from #rvv-e9 we have \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM}) = \\omega^2 \\,\\vec{r}_{PM}^{\\perp\\perp} = -\\omega^2\\,\\vec{r}_{PM} \\), as in the derivation of #rkg-e2. In 3D there will only be an instantaneous center if \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) is orthogonal to \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\), in which case there will many choices for the instantaneous center, all lying on a line in the \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) direction. If \\(M\\) is an instantaneous center, so it has zero velocity, then the velocity of any other point on the rigid body is given by the following equation. Velocity from the instantaneous center \\(M\\). #rkg-ev $$ \\vec{v}_{Q} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{MQ} $$ Point \\(M\\) is the instantaneous center of rotation for a rigid body rotating with angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\), and \\(Q\\) is any point on the body.  By definition the instantaneous center has \\( \\vec{v}_M = 0 \\) , so the velocity formula #rkg-er gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_M + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{MQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{MQ}. \\end{aligned} $$ animationresetshow labelsMovement: translation var. translation rotation var. rotation slide hinge circle spin reverse spin oscillation Point \\(P\\)\\(P\\) velocity\\(P\\) acceleration\\(P\\) pathang. vel. about \\(P\\)ang. acc. about \\(P\\)\\(P\\) at corner Body\\(Q\\) pathang. vel.ang. acc.inst. cent. \\(M\\) \\(Q\\) Velocity none\\( \\vec{v}_P \\) (trans.)\\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) (rot.)\\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) (total)all points \\(Q\\) Acceleration none\\( \\vec{a}_P \\) (trans.)\\( \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) (ang.)\\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\) (cent.)\\( \\vec{a}_Q \\) (total)all points Velocity and acceleration of points on a rigid body undergoing different motions. Constrained motion Copy content from here One of the most common type of motion is constrained motion, where an object is restricted to move in a certain way. Generally, a point constrained to move in a specific direction obeys the following equation: Constraint equation for a point \\(P\\). #rkc-pc $$ \\vec{v}_P \\cdot \\hat{n}_P = 0 $$ where \\( \\hat{n}_P \\) is the normal vector to the motion of point $P$. The above equation is difficult to apply to a system with a collection of points or particles. It is not the only way to derive constraint equations. For example, rigid body kinematics equations (also known as relative motion equations) are derived using the definition of a rigid body. Namely, the distance and angles between all points remain constant. See rigid body relations. It is often best to look at examples of constrained motion to see how constraint equations are differentiated to obtain velocity and acceleration. We can visualize the motion of several constrained systems, shown on the figure below. animationresetshow labelsshow velocitySystem:rod-circularslider-crank rod-circularTrace $Q$ slider-crankTrace \\(B\\)\\(B\\) path\\( \\hat{v}_C = \\hat{\\jmath} \\) + Example Problem: Sliding rod #rkc-xcl A uniform rod leaning against a wall has a fixed length of \\(\\ell = 10 \\rm\\ m\\). The bottom of the rod at point $P$ is \\(8 \\rm\\ m\\) from the wall. Point $P$ is moving away from the wall at a speed of \\(6 \\rm\\ m/s\\). The rod maintains contact with the wall and ground at all times. What is \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) of point $Q$, the point at the top of the rod?  To solve this, note the question states that the rod's length is fixed, and is not permitted to lose contact with the wall and ground. Therefore, the constraint equation is given by the Pythagorean theorem: $$ \\begin{aligned} x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = \\ell^2 \\end{aligned} $$ This becomes a related rates problem from calculus 1. Differentiating with respect to time, keeping in mind the chain rule: $$ \\begin{aligned} 2x_P\\dot{x}_P + 2y_Q\\dot{y}_Q = 0 \\end{aligned} $$ The quantity we're interested in is \\( \\dot{y}_Q \\) , or \\( v_Q \\), and \\( y_Q = \\sqrt{\\ell^2 - x_P^2} \\) . Solving yields \\( \\vec{v}_Q = -8\\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m/s \\) . Another way to solve this is using the rigid body relations, knowing that the distance and angles from the top to the bottom of the rod remains constant, which is a rigid body by definition. Using rigid body relations: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{v}_P + \\omega_z \\vec{r}_{PQ}^{\\perp} \\end{aligned} $$ where we have two unknowns:\\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) , and $\\vec\\omega$, and \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} = -\\ell \\cos\\theta \\hat{\\imath} + \\ell \\sin\\theta \\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m \\), where \\( \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x_P}{\\ell}\\right) \\). Therefore, \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ}^{\\perp} = -\\ell \\sin\\theta \\hat{\\imath} - \\ell \\cos\\theta \\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m \\) . Expanding the vector equation into its two scalar equations yields: $$ \\begin{aligned} v_{Qx} &= v_{Px} - \\omega_z \\ell \\sin\\theta \\\\ v_{Qy} &= v_{Py} - \\omega_z \\ell \\cos\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ Since the top of the rod can only move vertically, \\( v_{Qx} = 0, and \\omega_z = \\frac{v_{Px}}{\\ell \\sin\\theta} \\rm\\ rad/s \\) Since the bottom of the rod can only move horizontally, \\( v_{Py} = 0, and v_{Qy} = -\\omega_z \\ell \\cos\\theta \\rm\\ m/s \\) Plugging in $\\omega_z$ expression: $$ v_{Qy} = -\\frac{v_{Px}}{\\ell \\sin\\theta} \\ell \\cos\\theta = -v_{Px}\\cot\\theta \\rm\\ m/s $$ Plugging in the numbers yields the same result of \\( \\vec{v}_{Q} = -8\\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m/s \\) . Note in the rigid body relations method, we implicitly used the constraint equation for a point. Namely, we know that the top of the rod can only move vertically, so \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\cdot \\hat{n}_Q = 0 \\) , where \\( \\hat{n}_Q = \\hat{\\imath} \\) and \\( \\vec{v}_P \\cdot \\hat{n}_P = 0 \\) , where \\( \\hat{n}_P = \\hat{\\jmath} \\). In general, the steps involved in analyzing systems with constrained motions are as follows: Solution procedure for constrained motion. #rkc-cp $$ \\begin{aligned}&\\text{1.

Pulley \\(A\\) is free to move vertically, and pulley \\(B\\) is fixed to the top. The two pulleys are connected by an inextensible, massless rope. One block of mass \\(m_1\\) is connected to pulley \\(A\\) by a string, and another block of mass \\(m_2\\) is hanging from the rope connecting the two pulleys. Assume the pulleys' radii are negligbile. If \\(m_2\\) moves downwards at a velocity \\(v_2 = 6 \\rm\\ m/s\\) and acceleration \\(a_2 = 2 \\rm\\ m/s^2\\), what are the velocity and acceleration of \\(m_1\\)?  We will begin by underlining important information given in the question. Namely: The rope is inextensible, meaning the total length of the rope remains constant. This is our constraint.The pulleys are massless, meaning we do not need to consider any rotational motion they may exhibit.The pulleys radii' are negligbile, meaning we do not need to consider their radii as a part of the total length of the rope. Using the solution procedure highlighted in #rkc-cp: 1. Write down constraint equation in terms of distances/positions. If the rope's length remains constant, we need to choose a reference line to relate the distances of the masses to that reference line and set it equal to the rope's length. The following figure shows the reference line, as well as the masses' distances from that line. Note that \\(y_1\\) is only extended to pulley \\(A\\). Since the pulleys are massless, they will not rotate, and therefore \\(m_1\\) and pulley \\(A\\) will translate vertically together at the same rate. Now, we can write the total length of the rope in terms of those two distances. The total length of the rope,\\(L\\) will be: $$ 2y_1 + y_2 = L $$ 2. Differentiate once or twice with respect to time to obtain \\( \\vec{v} \\) and \\( \\vec{a} \\) relationships. Now, we can take two derivatives with respect to time to obtain the relationship between the speeds \\( v_1, v_2 \\) , and the accelerations \\( a_1, a_2 \\) . $$ \\begin{aligned} 2v_1 + v_2 &= 0 \\\\ 2a_1 + a_2 &= 0 \\end{aligned} $$ Notice that the length of the rope does not matter ultimately. This makes sense, as the length of the rope is constant, and therefore does not change with time. 3. Solve for the desired quantity. We are interested in both the velocity and acceleration of \\(m_1\\). Solving for \\( \\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{-\\vec{v}_2}{2} = 3\\hat{\\jmath}\\rm\\ m/s \\) and \\( \\vec{a}_1 = \\frac{-\\vec{a}_2}{2} = \\hat{\\jmath}\\rm\\ m/s^2 \\) Reflecting on the result obtained, it makes sense. The distance \\(m_1\\) has to travel up the rope is two times more than the length \\(m_2\\) has to travel. We can also draw a free-body diagram to understand this result further. We will return to this example further down when constraint forces are covered. Reference material Calculus and vectorsRigid bodiesKinetics of point massesKinetics of rigid bodiesFree body diagramsEnergy and work Applications Four-bar linkages Constraint forces If an object is constrained to move in a specific direction, by Newton's second law, there must be forces or moments preventing the movement of the object in that direction. Those are called constraint forces. The approach to solving for constraint forces is the same approach to solve for any forces/moments that are not constraint forces. Namely, drawing a free body diagram, and applying Newton's equations. See the solution procedure with Newton's equations. Let's return to our example of the rod leaning against a wall. + Example Problem: Constraint forces on a sliding rod. #rkc-xcf A uniform rod of mass \\(m\\) and length \\(\\ell\\) is leaning against a frictionless wall at an angle \\(\\phi\\) as shown. The rod starts sliding along a frictionless ground under the influence of gravity \\( \\vec{g} \\). What are the expressions of the constraint forces \\( \\vec{F}_P, \\vec{F}_Q \\) that ensure the rod maintains contact with the wall and ground at all times?  We will begin by drawing a free body diagram on the rod. Note that due to the constraint placed on the rod, point $P$ can only slide along the ground and therefore by #rkc-pc, \\( \\vec{F}_P \\) acts vertically. Similarly for point $Q$, \\( \\vec{F}_Q \\) acts horizontally. Applying Newton's second law: $$ \\sum \\vec{F}_{ext} = m\\vec{a}_C $$ Breaking it up into the scalar equations. Note we will use \\( \\ddot{x}_C, \\ddot{y}_C \\) to denote the acceleration of the center of mass $C$ in each direction. $$ \\begin{aligned} F_Q &= m\\ddot{x}_C \\\\ F_P - mg &= m\\ddot{y}_C \\end{aligned} $$ Now we can apply the solution procedure detailed in #rkc-cp to find the acceleration of point $C$. Due to our constraint, the following applies at all times: $$ x_C = \\frac{\\ell}{2}\\sin\\phi \\qquad \\qquad y_C = \\frac{\\ell}{2}\\cos\\phi $$ Differentiating twice, keeping in mind the chain rule: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ddot{x}_C &= -\\frac{\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\sin\\phi + \\frac{\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\cos\\phi \\\\ \\ddot{y}_C &= -\\frac{\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\cos\\phi - \\frac{\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\sin\\phi \\end{aligned} $$ Plugging into Newton's second law equations and solving for each constraint force yields: $$ \\begin{aligned} F_Q &= -\\frac{m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\sin\\phi + \\frac{m\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\cos\\phi \\\\ F_P &= -\\frac{m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\cos\\phi - \\frac{m\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\sin\\phi + mg \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Instance where rod loses contact with a wall. #rkc-xlc A uniform rod of mass \\(m\\) and length \\(\\ell\\) is leaning against a frictionless wall at rest at an angle \\(\\phi\\) as shown. The rod starts sliding on a frictionless ground under the influence of gravity \\( \\vec{g} \\). At what angle \\(\\theta\\) does the rod lose contact with the wall?  While there is contact with the wall, our constraint still holds. This means our constraint forces expressions from #rkc-cf still hold. We are only interested in the constraint force from the wall on the rod, \\( \\vec{F}_Q \\). at \\( \\theta \\): $$ F_Q = -\\frac{m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\sin\\theta + \\frac{m\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\cos\\theta $$ If the rod loses contact with the wall, then \\( \\vec{F}_Q = 0 \\). We have two unknowns: the angular velocity $\\dot\\theta$ and the angular acceleration $\\ddot\\theta$. However, we know that \\( \\ddot\\theta = \\frac{d\\dot\\theta}{dt} \\) , so if we obtain an expression for \\( \\dot\\theta \\), then finding \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) is possible. We can use conservation of energy to obtain an expression for \\( \\dot\\theta \\). Using the work-energy theorem: $$ W = \\Delta T + \\Delta V $$ The rod is sliding along frictionless surfaces, so there are no non-conservative forces present, and constraint forces do no work (See work done by a constraint force) Therefore: $$ \\begin{aligned} T_1 + V_1 &= T_2 + V_2 \\\\ 0 + mgh_{C, 1} &= \\frac{1}{2}mv_C^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{C, \\hat{k}}\\omega^2 + mgh_{C, 2} \\end{aligned} $$ From before: $$ \\begin{aligned} h_{C, 1} = y_{C, 1} = \\ell\\cos\\phi \\qquad h_{C, 2} = y_{C, 2} = \\ell\\cos\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ And the velocity of the center of mass at \\( \\theta \\): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= \\dot{x}_{C,2}\\hat{\\imath} + \\dot{y}_{C, 2}\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= \\ell\\dot\\theta\\cos\\theta \\hat{\\imath} - \\ell\\dot\\theta\\sin\\theta \\hat{\\jmath} \\end{aligned} $$ So \\( v_C \\) is simply \\( l\\dot\\theta \\). Plugging into our energy conservation, where \\( I_{C, \\hat{k}} = \\frac{1}{12}m\\ell^2 \\): $$ \\begin{aligned} mg\\ell\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{1}{2}m(\\ell\\dot\\theta)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}m\\ell^2 \\right) \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta \\\\ mg\\ell\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{1}{2}m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + \\frac{1}{24}m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta \\\\ mg\\ell\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{13}{24}m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ Solving for \\( \\dot\\theta^2 \\) : $$ \\dot\\theta^2 = \\frac{24g}{13\\ell}\\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) $$ Differentiating to obtain \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} 2\\dot\\theta\\ddot\\theta &= \\frac{24g}{13\\ell}\\sin\\theta\\dot\\theta \\\\ \\ddot\\theta & = \\frac{12g}{13\\ell}\\sin\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ Plugging our results into \\( F_Q \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} F_Q &= -\\frac{m\\ell\\frac{24g}{13\\ell}\\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right)}{2}\\sin\\theta + \\frac{m\\ell\\frac{12g}{13\\ell}\\sin\\theta}{2}\\cos\\theta \\\\ &= -\\frac{12}{13}mg\\sin\\theta \\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) + \\frac{6}{13}mg\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Setting \\( F_Q=0 \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{12}{13}mg\\sin\\theta \\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) &= \\frac{6}{13}mg\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ 2\\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) &= \\cos\\theta \\\\ 2\\cos\\phi - 2\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\theta &= 0 \\\\ 2\\cos\\phi - 3\\cos\\theta &= 0 \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Solving for \\( \\theta \\) yields \\( \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\cos\\phi\\right) \\) , or when the rod has fallen 2/3 of the original height. Note if the rod was unconstrained, the constraint we used still holds until the rod has fallen 2/3 of the original height. We can use rigid body relations to find the velocity of point $Q$ once the rod loses contact with the wall, and it will have both vertical and horizontal components of velocity, as expected. + Example Problem: Tension in a compound pulley system. #rkc-xtp Consider the compound pulley system shown, consisting of two massless pulleys \\(A, B\\). Pulley \\(A\\) is free to move vertically, and pulley \\(B\\) is fixed to the top. The two pulleys are connected by an inextensible, massless rope. One block of mass \\(m_1\\) is connected to pulley \\(A\\) by a string, and another block of mass \\(m_2\\) is hanging from the rope connecting the two pulleys. Assume the pulleys' radii are negligbile, and the rope can only slip. What is the tension \\(T\\) in the rope?  We added one more assumption to the ones made in #rkc-xcp. Namely, the rope can only slip. This simply means that the tension is the same at any point in the rope. We will begin by drawing a free body diagram and applying Newton's second law on three bodies: \\( m_1 \\), \\( m_2 \\) and pulley \\(A\\). We will neglect pulley \\(B\\) as it is fixed to the wall, and the results obtained from it are trivial. The free body diagram on pulley \\(A\\) is as follows: Applying Newton's second law: $$ 2T - T_2 = m_A a_A $$ Since the pulley is massless, that means \\( T_2 = 2T \\) . The free body diagram on \\( m_1 \\) is as follows: Applying Newton's second law: $$ 2T - m_1 g = m_1 a_1 $$ Finally, the free body diagram on \\( m_2 \\) is as follows: Applying Newton's second law: $$ T - m_2 g = m_2 a_2 $$ We have 3 unknowns, 2 equations. We apply our constraint equation from #rkc-xcp to relate the accelerations of \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\): $$ 2a_1 + a_2 = 0 $$ Solving for \\(T\\) from Newton's second law on \\( m_2 \\): $$ T = m_2 a_2 + m_2 g $$ Plugging it into Newton's second law on \\( m_1 \\): $$ 2m_2 a_2 + 2m_2 g - m_1 g = m_1 a_1 $$ Since \\( a_2 = -2a_1 \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} -4m_2 a_1 + 2m_2 g - m_1g &= m_1 a_1 \\\\ g\\left(2m_2 - m_1 \\right) &= a_1\\left(m_1 + 4m_2\\right) \\end{aligned} $$ Solving for \\( a_1 \\) : $$ a_1 = \\frac{g\\left(2m_2 - m_1 \\right)}{m_1 + 4m_2} $$ Plugging that result into Newton's second law on \\( m_1 \\) and solving for \\(T\\): $$ T = \\frac{m_1\\frac{g\\left(2m_2 - m_1 \\right)}{m_1 + 4m_2} + m_1g}{2} $$ Simplifying a little by multiplying the top and bottom by \\( m_1 + 4m_2 \\) : $$ T = \\frac{m_1g(2m_2 - m_1) + m_1g(m_1 + 4m_2)}{2(m_1 + 4m_2)} $$ We obtain our final result for the tension in the rope \\(T\\): $$ T = \\frac{3m_1m_2g}{m_1 + 4m_2} $$ Gears Standard sign convention Accelerations in contact (no slip) Applications Steering geometry Complete in \"Steering geometry\".

    "text": "Rigid Body Kinetics Center of mass (COM) The total mass of a rigid body is as follows: Total mass of a rigid body. #rcm-tm $$ m = \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\, dV $$  The mass of an infinitesimally small element of the rigid body $dm$ assuming constant density is: \\[ dm = \\rho \\, dV \\] Therefore, integrating over the entire volume of the body gives us the expression above. The center of mass of a rigid body can be calculated as follows: Center of mass \\(C\\) of a rigid body. #rcm-cm $$ \\begin{gathered} \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ \\( \\vec{r} \\) is the vector from a reference origin \\( O \\) to \\( dV \\). The integral term \\( \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\) is known as the \"first moment of mass\".  The center of mass of a collection of particles is given by the finite sum: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\, \\vec{r}_i $$ Therefore, for a continuous mass distribution and infinite number of particles, the sum becomes an integral and the masses become the mass of an infinitesimally small element on the rigid body: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\vec{r} dm $$ Where \\( dm = \\rho \\, dV \\) from the differential of #rcm-tm. Substituting in: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\frac{1}{m}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\vec{r} dm \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{m}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\vec{r} \\rho \\, dV \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{m}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Center of mass of a right-triangular plate. #rcm-xc A solid uniform right-triangular plate with mass \\( m \\) has width \\( w \\), height \\( h \\). Where is the center of mass \\( \\vec{r}_C \\)located?  In order to figure out where the center of mass is located, we will need to choose an origin. The origin chosen in this instant is where the base and height begin, as shown. Using the center of mass formula will allow us to calculate the vector shown below (i.e we are calculating \\( \\vec{r}_{OC} \\)). Using the formula #rcm-cm: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\frac{1}{m} \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{m} \\iint_{A} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, tdA \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Where \\( A \\) represents the surface area of the plate, and \\( t \\) is the thickness. We will assume the thickness is 1, as we are only interested in the center of mass in the \\( x \\)-\\( y \\) plane. Our triple integral with \\( dV \\)instead becomes a double integral with \\( dV = t dA \\). We therefore have: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\int_{y_1}^{y_2} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dA $$ We will redraw the figure and show the \\(dA\\) element. We will also find the \\(x\\)-coordinate and \\(y\\)-coordinate ranges for the body. Examining the figure above, we can see that the \\( x \\)-coordinate range is \\( 0 \\) to \\( w \\). Our \\( y \\)-coordinate range has a dependence on the \\( x \\)-value, and the equation of the hypotenuse is \\( y = h - \\frac{h}{w}x \\), using the point-slope formula. Therefore, the \\( y \\)-coordinate range is \\( 0 \\) to \\( h - \\frac{h}{w}x \\). As a result of this, we will have to integrate with respect to \\( y \\) first. All in all, our center of mass equation becomes: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dydx $$ where \\( vec{r} \\) is the distance to the \\( dA \\) element. We can see the coordinates of \\( dA \\) are \\([x,y]\\). Thus, \\( \\vec{r} = x\\hat{\\imath} + y\\hat{\\jmath} \\). Therefore: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\rho \\left(x\\hat{\\imath} + y\\hat{\\jmath}\\right) \\, dydx \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\left(x\\hat{\\imath} + y\\hat{\\jmath}\\right) \\, dydx \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\left[\\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\left(x\\hat{\\imath} \\, dy\\right)dx + \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\left(y\\hat{\\jmath} \\, dy\\right)dx\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\left[\\int_{0}^{w} x\\left(h - \\frac{h}{w}x\\right)\\hat{\\imath}dx + \\int_{0}^{w} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(h - \\frac{h}{w}x\\right)^2\\hat{\\jmath}dx\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\left[\\frac{w^2 h}{6}\\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{wh^2}{6}\\hat{\\jmath}\\right] \\end{aligned} $$ where \\( \\frac{\\rho}{m} = \\frac{1}{A} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}wh} = \\frac{2}{wh} \\). Substituting that in yields: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{3}w \\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{1}{3}h \\hat{\\jmath} $$ Meaning the center of mass for a right-triangular plate is located at 1/3rd of the width, and 1/3rd of the height. This formula has been used to calculate the center of mass of different common shapes. Finding the center of mass allows us to treat complex shapes as point-masses with all their mass at the center of mass. To find the center of mass of a body made up of composite shapes, we simply do the weighted average of each body by using the fact above. Center of mass (C) of composite bodies. #rcm-cb $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{m_1 \\vec{r}_1 + m_2 \\vec{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2} $$ \\( \\vec{r}_i \\) is the center of mass of the \\(i\\)th body. The whole body \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) is composed of sub-bodies \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\)  Finding the center of mass of the whole body follows directly from the fact that the integral over the whole body is the sum of the integrals over the sub-bodies. That is, for \\( \\mathcal{B} = \\mathcal{B}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2 \\) (and \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\)not overlapping with \\( \\mathcal{B}_2$ \\), we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\frac{1}{M}\\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{M}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{M}\\left[\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}_1} \\rho_1 \\vec{r}_1 \\, dV + \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho_2 \\vec{r}_2 \\, dV \\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{m_1 \\vec{r}_1 + m_2 \\vec{r}_2}{M} \\\\ &= \\frac{m_1 \\vec{r}_1 + m_2 \\vec{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Center of mass of an L-shaped plate. #rcm-xl A solid uniform L-shaped plate has mass \\(m\\) and dimensions as shown. What is the location of the center of mass?  In order to figure out where the center of mass is located, we will need to choose an origin. The origin chosen here is the corner shown. Then we must realize that the L-shape can be decomposed into four square plates, as shown. Each square plate has the same mass, so: $$ m_i = \\frac{1}{4}m $$ Using the addition formula #rcm-cb: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i \\vec{r}_i $$ where: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_1 &= d\\hat{\\imath} + 3d\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{r}_2 &= d\\hat{\\imath} + d\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{r}_3 &= 3d\\hat{\\imath} + d\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{r}_4 &= 5d\\hat{\\imath} + d\\hat{\\jmath} \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting in: $$ \\begin{aligned} x_C = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{3}{4}md + \\frac{5}{4}md}{m} = \\frac{5}{2}d \\\\ y_C = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md}{m} = \\frac{3}{2}d \\end{aligned} $$ Thus, the center of mass of the L-shape plate: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{5}{2}d \\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{3}{2}d \\hat{\\jmath} $$ And its location on the plate is shown below.

The moment of inertia expresses how hard it is to produce an angular acceleration of the body about this axis. That is, a body with high moment of inertia resists angular acceleration, so if it is not rotating then it is hard to start a rotation, while if it is already rotating then it is hard to stop. The moment of inertia plays the same role for rotational motion as the mass does for translational motion (a high-mass body resists is hard to start moving and hard to stop again). Moment of inertia about axis \\( \\hat{a} \\) through point (P). #rem-ei $$ \\begin{gathered} I_{P,\\hat{a}} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ \\text{(units: $\\rm kg\\ m^2$)} \\end{gathered} $$ The distance \\(r \\) is the perpendicular distance to \\( dV \\) from the axis through \\(P\\) in direction \\( \\hat{a}. \\) + Warning: Mass moments of inertia are different to area moments of inertia. #rem-wm Be advised that the \"moment of inertia\" encountered in Statics is not the same as the moment of inertia used in Dynamics. Strictly speaking, the \"moment of inertia\" from Statics shouldn't even be called \"moment of inertia.\" What it really is is the \"second moment of area.\" Below are the definitions of two such second moments of area: $$ J_{xx}=\\iint_{A}{y^{2}dA} $$ $$ J_{yy}=\\iint_{A}{x^{2}dA} $$ In contrast, the moment of inertia (about the \\(z\\)-axis) is defined as stated above. For example, a rectangle of base \\(b\\) and height \\(h\\) has the following moments about its centroid \\(C\\): $$ J^{C}_{xx}=\\frac{1}{12}bh^{3} $$ $$ J^{C}_{yy}=\\frac{1}{12}b^{3}h $$ $$ I^{C}_{zz}=\\frac{1}{12}m(b^{2}+h^{2}) $$ Notice that the dimensions of the two quantities are different. While the dimension of second moment of area is \\( (\\text{length})^{4} \\), the dimension of moment of inertia is \\( (\\text{mass})(\\text{length})^{2} \\). When doing dynamics problems with moments of inertia, you should not use the formulas you remember for second moment of area instead. You will get the wrong answer! Observe that the moment of inertia is proportional to the mass, so that doubling the mass of an object will also double its moment of inertia. In addition, the moment of inertia is proportional to the square of the size of the object, so that doubling every dimension of an object (height, width, etc) will cause it to have four times the moment of inertia. Moments of inertia about coordinate axes through point (P). #rem-ec $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,x} &= I_{P,xx} = I_{P,\\hat\\imath} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (y^2 + z^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ I_{P,y} &= I_{P,yy} = I_{P,\\hat\\jmath} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (z^2 + x^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ I_{P,z} &= I_{P,zz} = I_{P,\\hat{k}} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\end{aligned} $$ The coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\) in the body are measured from point \\(P\\).  The distance\\(r\\) in the moment of inertia integral #rem-ei is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the infinitesimal volume \\(dV \\). If we are using rectangular coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\) measured from point \\(P\\), and the axis of rotation is one of the coordinate axes, then the perpendicular distance is very simple. As an example, consider the case when the axis of rotation \\( \\hat{a} \\) is the \\( \\hat{k} \\) axis, as shown in the figure. Then the perpendicular distance \\(r\\) satisfies \\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\\), giving the coordinate expression above. The other two coordinate axes are similar. + Example Problem: Moment of inertia of a square plate. #rem-xs A solid square uniform plate has mass \\(m\\), side-length \\( \\ell \\), and thickness \\( h \\). What is the moment of inertia about the \\(z \\)-axis through the center of mass \\(C\\)?  We will use the coordinate formula #rem-ec. To do this, we measure the position from the point \\(C\\) about which we are computing the moment of inertia, so the coordinate origin is at \\(C\\). The figure to the right shows the 3D configuration of the body, where we see that the \\(x\\)-coordinate range of the body is \\(-\\ell/2\\) to \\(\\ell/2\\), and the same for the \\(y\\)-coordinate, while the \\(z\\)-coordinate ranges from \\(-h/2\\) to \\(h/2\\). Taking the density of the plate to be $\\rho$, we thus have: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{C,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^3 + y^2 x\\right)\\right]_{x = -\\ell/2}^{x = \\ell/2} \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\ell^3 + y^2 \\ell \\right) \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\ell^3 y + \\frac{1}{3} y^3 \\ell \\right) \\right]_{y = -\\ell/2}^{y = \\ell/2} \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\ell^4 + \\frac{1}{12} \\ell^4 \\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\frac{1}{6}\\ell^4 \\,dz \\\\ &= \\left[ \\rho \\frac{1}{6}\\ell^4 z \\right]_{z = -h/2}^{z = h/2} \\\\ &= \\rho \\frac{1}{6}\\ell^4 h. \\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the plate is \\( m = \\rho \\ell^2 h \\), so we can write the moment of inertia as \\( I_{C,z} = \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2. \\) The square plate moment of inertia is actually a special case of the rectangular prism formula #rem-er with \\( \\ell_y = \\ell_z = \\ell \\) Did you know? We are always considering the moment of inertia to be a scalar value \\( I \\), which is valid for rotation about a fixed axis. For more complicated dynamics with tumbling motion about multiple axes simultaneously, it is necessary to consider the full 3\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u0097\u00c2\u00a03 moment of inertia matrix: $$ I = \\begin{bmatrix} I_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} \\\\ I_{yx} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} \\\\ I_{zx} & I_{zy} & I_{zz} \\end{bmatrix} $$ The three scalar moments of inertia from #rem-ec appear on the diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are called the products of inertia and are given by $$ I_{xy} = -\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho xy \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz, $$ and similarly for the other terms. The angular momentum of a rigid body is given by \\( \\vec{H} = I \\vec{\\omega} \\), which is the matrix product of the moment of inertia matrix with the angular velocity vector. This is important in advanced dynamics applications such as unbalanced rotating shafts and the precession of gyroscopes. Parallel axis theorem Parallel axis theorem. #rem-el $$ I_{P,\\hat{a}} = I_{C,\\hat{a}} + m \\, d^2 $$ Here \\( d \\) is the perpendicular distance between the axes through \\( P \\) and \\(C \\) in direction \\( \\hat{a} \\), so \\( d = \\| \\operatorname*{Comp}(\\vec{r}_{CP}, \\hat{a})\\| \\).  To easily compute the moments of inertia relative to axes through \\( P \\) and \\( C \\) it is easiest to choose a coordinate system aligned with the rotation axis direction \\( \\hat{a} \\). We will choose coordinates \\( (x,y,z) \\) measured from the center of mass \\( C \\) and with the \\(z\\)-axis \\( \\hat{k} \\) in the direction of \\( \\hat{a} \\), as shown in the figure. As we integrate over the body with infinitesimal volume \\( dV \\) at position \\( (x,y,z) \\) from \\( C \\), we will write the distance from the axis through \\( C \\) as \\( r_c \\) and the distance from the axis through \\( P \\) as \\( r_P \\), as illustrated. The distance between the two rotation axes is \\( d \\). In the chosen coordinate system this means that: $$ \\begin{aligned} {r_C}^2 &= x^2 + y^2 \\\\ {r_P}^2 &= (x - x_P)^2 + (y - y_P)^2 \\\\ d^2 &= {x_P}^2 + {y_P}^2, \\end{aligned} $$ where \\( P \\) has position \\( (x_P, y_P, z_P) \\) in these coordinates. Computing the integral #rem-ec to find the moment of inertia about the axis through \\( P \\) in direction \\( \\hat{a} \\) now gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,\\hat{a}} &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho {r_P}^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\left((x - x_P)^2 + (y - y_P)^2\\right) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\left(x^2 - 2 x x_P + {x_P}^2 + y^2 - 2 y y_P + {y_P}^2\\right) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz - 2 x_P \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho x \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &\\quad - 2 y_P \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho y \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz + ({x_P}^2 + {y_P}^2) \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho {r_C}^2 \\,dV + d^2 \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\,dV \\\\ &= I_{C,\\hat{a}} + m d^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Here we used the coordinate representation of the center of mass to realize that the \\( x \\) coordinate of \\( C \\) is \\( x_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho x \\,dV \\), but because our coordinates are measured from \\( C \\) we must have \\( x_C = 0 \\) and so \\( \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho x \\,dV = 0 \\). The integral of \\( \\rho y \\) is similarly zero. + Warning: Parallel axis theorem must start from center of mass \\( C \\). #rem-wl The parallel axis theorem does not apply to any two parallel rotation axes. The rotation axis on the right-hand-side of the equation must be through the center of mass \\( C \\), although the other axis can be through any point \\( P \\). + Warning: Parallel axis theorem \\( d \\) is perpendicular distance, not \\( r_{CP} \\). #rem-wp The distance \\( d \\) in the parallel axis theorem is the perpendicular distance between the axes through points \\( P \\) and \\( C \\). This will normally not be the same as the distance \\( r_{CP} \\) between \\( P \\) and \\( C \\), except in 2D problems or if it happens that \\( \\vec{r}_{CP} \\) is already perpendicular to the rotation axis \\( \\hat{a} \\). The distance \\( d \\) can be computed by taking the orthogonal complement of \\( \\vec{r}_{CP} \\) with respect to \\( \\hat{a} \\), so \\( d = \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{r}_{CP}, \\hat{a})\\| \\). + Example Problem: Moment of inertia of a square plate about a corner. #rem-xc A solid uniform square plate has mass \\( m \\), side-length \\( \\ell \\), and thickness \\( h \\). What is the moment of inertia about the \\( z \\)-axis through the corner \\( P \\)? Use the answer to Example Problem #rem-xs and the parallel axis theorem #rem-el.  In Example Problem #rem-xs we computed the moment of inertia of a square place about the center to be \\( I_{C,z} = \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2 \\). The parallel axis theorem #rem-el now gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,z} &= I_{C,z} + m \\, {r_{CP}}^2 \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2 + m \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right)^2 \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{3} m \\ell^2. \\end{aligned} $$ To check our answer, we can compute the corner moment of inertia directly by integrating with formula #rem-ec. To do this, we put the coordinate origin at the point \\( P \\) about which we wish to find the moment of inertia, as shown in 3D to the right. From this we see that the \\(x \\)range is \\(0\\) to \\( \\ell \\), the same for the \\( y \\) range, and the \\(z\\) range is \\(-h/2\\) to \\(h/2\\). The integral formula now gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_0^{\\ell} \\int_{0}^{\\ell} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{0}^{\\ell} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^3 + y^2 x\\right)\\right]_{x = 0}^{x = \\ell} \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{0}^{\\ell} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ell^3 + y^2 \\ell \\right) \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ell^3 y + \\frac{1}{3} y^3 \\ell \\right) \\right]_{y = 0}^{y = \\ell} \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ell^4 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ell^4 \\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\frac{2}{3}\\ell^4 \\,dz \\\\ &= \\left[ \\rho \\frac{2}{3}\\ell^4 z \\right]_{z = -h/2}^{z = h/2} \\\\ &= \\rho \\frac{2}{3}\\ell^4 h. \\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the plate is \\( m = \\rho ell^2 h \\), so we can write the final expression for the moment of inertia is $$ I_{P,z} = \\frac{2}{3} m \\ell^2. $$ This is the same as the expression we obtained above using the parallel axis theorem, but clearly the parallel axis theorem version is much easier. One consequence of the parallel axis theorem is that the moment of inertia can only increase as we move the rotation point \\( P \\) away from the center of mass \\( C \\). This means that the point with the lowest moment of inertia is always the center of mass itself. A second consequence of the parallel axis theorem is that moving the point \\( P \\) along the direction \\( \\hat{a} \\) doesn't change the moment of inertia, because the axis of rotation is not changing as the point moves along the axis itself. Additive theorem Adding moments of inertia. #rem-ea $$ I^{\\mathcal{B}}_{P,\\hat{a}} = I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,\\hat{a}} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,\\hat{a}} $$ The whole body \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) is composed of sub-bodies \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\).  The addition of moments of inertia for sub-bodies to give the full moment of inertia follows directly from the fact that the integral over the whole body is the sum of the integrals over the sub-bodes. That is, for \\( \\mathcal{B} = \\mathcal{B}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2 \\) (and \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) not overlapping with \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\)), we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} I^{\\mathcal{B}}_{P,\\hat{a}} &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B_1} \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B_1}} \\rho r^2 \\,dV + \\int_{\\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,\\hat{a}} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,\\hat{a}}. \\end{aligned} $$ + Warning: To add moments of inertia they must be about the same axis. #rem-wa It is only valid to add together moments of inertia for different sub-bodies if each moment of inertia is computed about the same axis of rotation. For example, consider \\( I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} \\) and \\( I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{C_2,z} \\), which are the moments of inertia of bodies \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\) about each of their individual centers of mass \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) (with axis direction \\( z \\)). Now it is physically meaningless to form the sum \\( I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{C_2,z} \\), because each moment of inertia is about a different axis. We must first shift both moments of inertia to a common axis point \\( P \\) (perhaps by using the parallel axis theorem), and then we can meaningfully add them together. + Example Problem: Moment of inertia of an L-shaped plate. #rem-xl A solid uniform L-shaped plate has mass \\(m\\) and dimensions as shown. What is the moment of inertia about the \\(z\\)-axis through the corner \\(P\\)?  Recall that in Example Problem #rem-xs we computed the moment of inertia of a square place about the center to be \\( I_{C,z} = \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2 \\). To use this together with the parallel axis theorem #rem-el and the additive theorem #rem-ea, we must first realize that the L-shape can be decomposed into four square plates, as shown. Each small square body has the same mass and the same moment of inertia about its center, so: $$ \\begin{aligned} m_1 &= \\frac{1}{4} m \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} &= \\frac{1}{6} m_1 (2d)^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) 4d^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2, \\end{aligned} $$ and similarly for each other small square body. Now individual moments of inertia about the corner $P$ can be found using the parallel axis theorem: $$ \\begin{aligned} I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} + m_1 \\, {r_{C_1P}}^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) \\left(d^2 + (3d)^2\\right) = \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{C_2,z} + m_2 \\, {r_{C_2P}}^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) \\left(d^2 + d^2\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} m d^2 \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_3}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,z} = \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_4}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_4}_{C_4,z} + m_4 \\, {r_{C_4P}}^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) \\left((5d)^2 + d^2\\right) = \\frac{20}{3} m d^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Here we observed that body \\( \\mathcal{B}_3 \\) will have the same moment of inertia as \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) , saving some computation. Combining the individual moments of inertia now gives us the total: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_3}_{P,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_4}_{P,z} \\\\ &= \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 + \\frac{2}{3} m d^2 + \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 + \\frac{20}{3} m d^2\\\\ &= \\frac{38}{3} m d^2. \\end{aligned} $$ We could also directly compute the total moment of inertia using the integral formula #rem-ec, which would be quite complex. Basic shapes The moments of inertia listed below are all computed directly from the integrals #rem-ec. Point mass: moments of inertia #rem-ep $$ I_{P,z} = m r^2 $$ Rectangular prism: moments of inertia #rem-er $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,x}&=\\frac{1}{12}m({\\ell_y}^2+{\\ell_z}^2)\\\\I_{C,y}&=\\frac{1}{12}m({\\ell_z}^2+{\\ell_x}^2)\\\\I_{C,z}&=\\frac{1}{12}m({\\ell_x}^2+{\\ell_y}^2)\\end{aligned} $$  The calculation for any of the axes is the same, so we will only write out the derivation of \\( I_{C,z} \\) here. We use #rem-ec, which gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{C,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\int_{-\\ell_y/2}^{\\ell_y/2} \\int_{-\\ell_x/2}^{\\ell_x/2} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\int_{-\\ell_y/2}^{\\ell_y/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^3 + y^2 x\\right)\\right]_{x = -\\ell_x/2}^{x = \\ell_x/2} \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\int_{-\\ell_y/2}^{\\ell_y/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}{\\ell_x}^3 + y^2 \\ell_x \\right) \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}{\\ell_x}^3 y + \\frac{1}{3} y^3 \\ell_x \\right) \\right]_{y = -\\ell_y/2}^{y = \\ell_y/2} \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}{\\ell_x}^3 \\ell_y + \\frac{1}{12} \\ell_x {\\ell_y}^3 \\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\rho \\ell_x \\ell_y \\frac{1}{12}\\left( {\\ell_x}^2 + {\\ell_y}^2\\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\left[ \\rho \\ell_x \\ell_y \\frac{1}{12}\\left( {\\ell_x}^2 + {\\ell_y}^2\\right) z \\right]_{z = -\\ell_z/2}^{z = \\ell_z/2} \\\\ &= \\rho \\ell_x \\ell_y \\ell_z \\frac{1}{12}\\left( {\\ell_x}^2 + {\\ell_y}^2\\right). \\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the plate is \\( m=\\rho\\ell_x\\ell_y\\ell_z \\), so we can write the moment of inertia as $$ I_{C,z}=\\frac{1}{12}m\\left({\\ell_x}^2+{\\ell_y}^2\\right).\\ $$ Cylindrical thick shell: moments of inertia #rem-ey $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,x}&=I_{C,y}=\\frac{1}{12}m(3({r_1}^2+{r_2}^2)+\\ell^2)\\\\I_{C,z}&=\\frac{1}{2}m({r_1}^2+{r_2}^2)\\end{aligned} $$  To compute the integrals in #rem-ec it is convenient to switch to cylindrical coordinates: $$ \\begin{aligned}x &= r \\cos\\theta \\\\y &= r \\sin\\theta \\\\z &= z.\\end{aligned}\\ $$ The Jacobian of this coordinate transformation is: $$ \\begin{aligned}J &= \\begin{vmatrix}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z} \\\\\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z} \\\\\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial z}\\end{vmatrix}= \\begin{vmatrix}\\cos\\theta & -r \\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\\\sin\\theta & r \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\\end{vmatrix}= r \\cos^2\\theta + r \\sin^2\\theta= r.\\end{aligned}\\ $$ Starting with the \\( z \\) axis, the moment of inertia is thus: $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_{r_1}^{r_2}\\rho \\left( (r \\cos\\theta)^2 + (r \\sin\\theta)^2 \\right) \\,J \\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_{r_1}^{r_2}\\rho r^3 \\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left[\\rho \\frac{1}{4} r^4 \\right]_{r = r_1}^{r = r_2} \\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\theta \\right]_{\\theta = 0}^{\\theta = 2\\pi} \\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\,dz \\\\&= \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) z \\right]_{z = -\\ell/2}^{z = \\ell/2} \\\\&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho \\ell \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right).\\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the cylindrical shell is \\( m = \\rho(\\pi {r_2}^2 - \\pi {r_1}^2) \\ell \\) , so we can write the moment of inertia as $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,z}&= \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m}{{r_2}^2 - {r_1}^2}\\left( {r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\\\&= \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m}{{r_2}^2 - {r_1}^2}\\left( {r_2}^2 + {r_1}^2 \\right) \\left( {r_2}^2 - {r_1}^2 \\right) \\\\&= \\frac{1}{2} m\\left( {r_2}^2 + {r_1}^2 \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ $$ Due to rotational symmetry of the cylinder, the moment of inertia will be the same about any axis orthogonal to \\( z \\) , so we will just write out the derivation for \\( I_{C,x} \\) here.

Applications Accelerating and braking 2D rigid body model Consider a car sitting stationary on the ground, as shown below. We will take the entire car plus wheels to be a single rigid body. Clearly this is inaccurate (the wheels can't turn), but it is still useful. We start with the car stationary, sitting on the road. Gravity acts downward through the center of mass, while there are upwards reaction forces on the wheels and corresponding equal and opposite forces downwards on the ground. Because the car is not accelerating, the total forces on the car are in balance, as we can see on the free body diagram. When the driver presses down on the gas pedal, this results in the car pushing back on the road, giving a net forward force on the driving wheels (the back wheels for our car), and the car accelerates up to cruising speed. Here we are including air resistance but neglecting rolling resistance, and while cruising at constant speed the driving force exactly balances the drag force from air resistance. When the driver presses down on the brake pedal, the car pushes on the road to slow down, giving backward forces on both wheels and causing the car to decelerate to a stop. accelerate brake free body diagram components animation Repeat the acceleration/braking cycle a few times while showing the free body diagram. Observe the horizontal and vertical forces of the road on the car wheels. Also view the forces both in vector components and as total force vectors. The vertical forces of the road on the car always need to balance the gravitational force, but we can see that the distribution between front and rear wheels changes as the car accelerates and decelerates. This is because the horizontal driving and braking forces are below the center of mass and produce a moment. The vehicle is not rotating, so this moment must be counteracted by the ground forces. The force directions mean that the rear wheels take more weight during acceleration, while the front wheels take more weight during braking. Traction, acceleration, and braking The maximum force with which the car can push against the road is limited by the friction coefficient of the tire multiplied by the normal force. This applies both during acceleration and braking. To accelerate as hard as possible, we should thus use a rear-wheel drive layout. If we accelerate too hard, however, then the back wheels will slip and experience wheelspin, because the dynamic coefficient of friction is lower than the static coefficient. While high-performance applications generally want to maintain traction in all cases, the impressive effects of traction loss are sometimes deliberately produced. Spinning the rear wheels in a burnout produces smoke as the tires vaporize due to the heat from friction. Drag racers perform a burnout at the start of a race to clean the tires and heat them to an optimal temperature. To easily produce a burnout a line lock can be installed to enable the brakes to be applied only to the front wheels (although this is often illegal on street cars). Alternatively, a burnout can be performed by disengaging the clutch, running the engine at a high revs, and then rapidly engaging the clutch. The high angular momentum of the engine then provides a rotational impulse to the rear wheels, causing them to lose traction. Even if traction is maintained during acceleration, a second problem that may occur is that the torque from the rear wheels can be enough to lift the front wheels off the ground, so that the vehicle performs a wheelie. This occurs very easily for motorbikes and BMX bicycles, due to a high center of mass to wheelbase ratio, but can also occur for cars with poor geometry and sufficient power. The problems of wheel slip and wheel lift-off occur in reverse while braking. Any car with well-maintained brakes has sufficient braking power to cause the wheels to lock, even in dry conditions with good traction. For this reason many cars now include anti-lock braking systems (ABS), which detect wheel locking and rapidly pulse the brake force to prevent locking. Even better than this are electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) systems, which apply the maximal brake force to each wheel while maintaining traction and control, better than any unassisted human driver could achieve. Due to the weight transfer to the front wheels during braking, the front brakes generally apply much greater force and thus wear out sooner than the rear brakes. Did you know? Using ABS to mean Anti-lock Brake System is an example of a backronym. This is where the name ABS came first, and then Anti-lock Brake System was made up later to fit the letters as an ackronym. In fact ABS comes from the German phrase Antiblockiersystem (literally: Anti Locking System). Traction, acceleration, and braking To understand how forces and moments act on the wheels, we need to separate out the single rigid-body model into multiple rigid bodies. The simplest version of this has one rigid body for the body, and four rigid bodies for the wheels. We will assume that the two front wheels always act as a pair (same forces, same motion), and similarly for the two back wheels. Again we start with the car stationary, and on the free body diagram we see the balance of vertical forces. Remember that the force shown on each wheel is really doubled, as there are two front and two rear wheels. If we now accelerate, then we see a clockwise moment applied to the rear (driving) wheels. This causes the wheel to rotate, but friction forces means that it must roll without slipping, so there must be a forward contact force causing it to accelerate forwards. Counteracting this is a backwards reaction force from the car on the wheel. On the car we see that there are equal and opposite forces and moments at the axles. Just as in the single rigid body case, we have a net horizontal force causing forward acceleration, and moment balance means that the weight of the car is transferred primarily to the rear wheels. accelerate brake free body diagram components animation Braking applies backwards moments to both wheels, causing them to slow down. To maintain non-slip, there is a backwards force from the ground at the point of contact. Because the wheel is slowing down, the car pushes forward on the axle. The ground/axle forces are trying to rotate the wheel forward, which must be counteracted by the braking moment. The braking moment is thus counteracting both the rotational inertia of the wheel, as well as the force couple from the ground/axle forces. Of these, the force couple is much larger (stopping a wheel without the car attached would be comparatively easy for the brakes). During braking we see again the weight being transferred to the front wheels. More complex models While we can learn a lot about car performance from the simple rigid body and multi-body models, there is a great deal of physics neglected by these models, which can be important for engineering design. Both the car and the tires are deformable bodies. The deformation of the tire is responsible for the contact patch which generates the friction forces that allow a car to accelerate and brake. The physics of the frictional contact between the tire and ground can be very complex, as can the geometry of the tire. Modern tires have complex tread patterns with grooves and lugs that are designed to channel away water and snow, maintaining traction even in challenging conditions. As well as being individually deformable, the wheels are are not rigidly connected to the car body as above, but they are actually connected by a suspension system, consisting of linkages, springs, and shock absorbers. These enable both a comfortable ride and safe handling of the vehicle. The simple models above included a simple model of air resistance, but they neglected rolling resistance. This is the force primarily produced by the tire being compressed and re-expanded at the contact with the ground as it rolls, producing a backward force on the wheel. Using steel wheels on steel can result in trains having up to ten times lower coefficients of rolling resistance than car tires, which is one reason for the efficiency of rail transport. Did you know? There is evidence that the wrinkling of fingers in water may serve the same purpose as tread patters on tires, improving traction in wet conditions by forming channels to carry away water. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that finger wrinkling relies on an active nervous system response, meaning that the fingers of corpses cannot wrinkle (but what about zombies' fingers?). Brake system design The above model shows equal brake force applied on the front and rear wheels. This both inefficient and dangerous, as the rear wheels will lock while the front wheels are still turning. See #avs for steering and sliding. We want to apply more force on the front brakes, so that we can deliver the most total force while still having no sliding. This can be achieved by electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) systems, however traditional systems are also possible. The basic outline of a brake system is that the brake pedal pushes on a master cylinder, which compresses hydraulic brake fluid in the brake lines. This then pushes on slave cylinders in each wheel, which push the brake pads onto the brake rotors (for disc brakes; drum brakes are somewhat different). The combination of slave cylinders and brake pads and their housing is called a brake caliper. To apply more force to the front brakes, one simple system used in practice is to have the front-wheel slave cylinders have a larger diameter than those on the rear wheels. Because the pressure in the brake lines is the same everywhere, the force exerted by the pistons is proportional to their cross-sectional area, resulting in more force with the larger-diameter front-wheel cylinders. Modern cars use more advanced systems. The master cylinder typically contains two pistons in a parallel arrangement, so that it can apply pressure to the front or rear brake lines even if the other brake line develops a leak. A metering valve applies pressure to the rear brakes before the front, improving vehicle steering stability and allowing mixed drum/disc systems to be used. A pressure differential valve detects brake hydraulic leaks by sensing different front/rear line pressures. A proportioning valve assists with applying a different pressure distribution to the rear brakes. Car model This is a 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback. The mass of the car body is 1100 kg and each of the wheels has mass 20 kg, giving a total mass of 1180 kg. We assume that the wheels are uniform cylinders. The dimensions of the car are shown below. $$ \\begin{aligned} h_1 &= {0.31\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_1 &= {0.98\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_2 &= {0.29\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_2 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_3 &= {0.79\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_3 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_4 &= {0.80\\rm\\ m} \\end{aligned} $$ The force of air resistance was computed above using the quadratic drag equation which is a good approximation for medium- to high-velocity motion in air: \\( F_{\\rm D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 C_{\\rm D} A \\) Here \\( F_{\\rm D} \\) is the drag force, \\( \\rho = 1.23\\rm\\ kg/m^3 \\) is the air density, \\(v\\) is the velocity, \\( C_{\\ D} \\) is the drag coefficient (taken to be 0.3 for the Mustang), and \\(A\\) is the reference area (approximately the cross-sectional area, taken to be \\(2.2\\rm\\ m^2\\) for the Mustang). Banked turns Complete in \"Banked turns\". Include all the information starting at \"2D rigid body model\". Refer back to \\ref sub:PartKin_turns 2D Rigid body model We now use a single rigid body model for the bus and we will do everything in 2D. Below we see a front-on diagram of the bus, with the inside of the track to the left. If we turn on the free body diagram, then we see that the weight of the bus is supported by two forces, one on each wheel. If we increase \\(\\theta\\) then the weight is supported more by the down-slope wheel, and we also see sideways friction forces appear to stop the bus from sliding. If the slope becomes too steep, then the normal force on the up-slope wheel reverses direction, indicating that it is holding the wheel down onto the road. Physically this cannot happen, so at this point the bus would tip over. We needed this rigid-body model to understand this tipping behavior, as we couldn't model this with the point mass model. Depending on the value of the friction coefficient, the bus may either slide or roll first as \\(\\theta\\) increases. free body diagram components Road bank angle: \\(\\theta = \\) 45\\(^\\circ\\) Bus speed: \\(v = \\) 30 \\(\\rm m/s\\) If we now set the bank angle \\(\\theta\\) back to zero, we can start to increase the speed \\(v\\). Now we see that the wheel on the inside of the track takes less of the weight, and the friction forces now stop the bus from sliding outwards on the track. If the bus goes too fast then it will roll outwards on the track (assuming the friction coefficient is high enough that it didn't slide first). Having considered both a banked road with stationary bus, and a moving bus on a horizontal road, we can now combine them to see the advantage of having a banked road when the bus is cornering. Choose a bus velocity, and then change the bank angle \\(\\theta\\), so that the friction force is reduced (helping to avoid sliding) and the normal forces on the wheels are more evenly balanced (helping to avoid rolling). For any given speed, we can choose a bank angle so that there is simultaneously no sideways friction force and also exactly balanced normal forces. This is the safest bank angle for this speed. Design of roads, tracks, and rail A straight road generally has the center somewhat higher than the edges to allow water to run off. This is called cross slope or camber. When it is desired to have a banked turn, then the outer edge of the road is raised to produce superelevation, with the outer edge rising above both the center and the inner edge. The bank angle is chosen based on the radius of curvature of the turn and the expected speed of cars going around the turn, while still allowing for the fact that cars might be moving slowly or even stopped. The angle should thus not be chosen to eliminate all friction forces when cars are traveling at maximum speed, as this would be dangerous if traffic had to stop on the road. Velodromes are arenas with tracks designed for high-speed bicycle races, as shown below, with speeds up to 85 km/h. The bank angle on velodrome tracks is chosen to minimize sideways forces on the bicycles when they are traveling at near maximum speeds, so the angle chosen depends on the radius of curvature of the track corners. For example, the Blaine velodrome track pictured below is 250 m long and has a 43\u00b0 bank angle on the corners and 15\u00b0 banking on the straightaways. Bicycle riders on a banked turn at the Blaine velodrome, part of the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota. Image source: flikr user flyinfoto (CC BY 2.0) (full-sized image). High-speed trains such as the French TGV operate at speeds of over 300 km/h and have run at up to 575 km/h. To accommodate cornering at such speeds, track bends are constructed with a large radius of curvature (at least 7 km for new tracks) and a bank angle of up to about 7\u00b0 (180 mm maximum superelevation with Standard gauge of 1435 mm). For railways, banking the track is know as cant. An alternative approach for cornering with trains is to leave the track relatively flat and to tilt the train as it travels around a corner. This allows high-speed trains to operate on regular tracks, while maintaining safety and comfort for the passengers. For example, the Queensland Rail Tilt Train operates at 180 km/h by tilting at up to 5\u00b0 around corners. As we see from our rigid body analysis above, tilting the train will help with avoiding tipping over at high speeds, but will not help with reducing horizontal friction forces. Even with a tilting train, entering a curve at too high a speed will lead to disastrous results. Did you know? The Blaine velodrome in Minnesota was designed by the famous Schuermann velodrome architects and built from the extremely durable African Afzelia hardwood. Velodrome races are always counter-clockwise and use special bikes with fixed chains (no freewheeling, no gears) and no brakes. The corners are scarily steep: Image credit: Tom McGoldrick (full sized image). Did you know? High-speed trains such as the French TGV and German ICE require many sophisticated engineering techniques to enable travel at extreme speed. Very smooth rails are needed, so the track is formed by welding the segments together into one precisely-aligned continuous steel line. The steel rails conduct heat too well for conventional welding, so thermite welding is used to join the track segments. At high speeds the train drivers are unable to see railway signals on the side of the track. Electronic signaling systems are used to communicate to the drivers, either through the tracks for the TGV or via additional cables for the ICE. Friction-based brakes produce too much heat, as they would need to absorb the kinetic energy of several hundred tonnes of train moving at over 300 km/h. Instead, dynamic breaking is used, in which the electric motors powering the trains are run in reverse as generators and the energy is shed as heat in resistor arrays. At extremely high speeds, the wheels themselves cannot provide sufficient traction to enable braking, so technologies like magnetic induction brakes are being developed, which directly push against the rails without involving the wheels at all. Bus model The bus model used above is a Setra S 411 HD coach. The mass of the vehicle is 12.6 t and the dimensions are shown below. $$ \\begin{aligned} h_1 &= {0.31\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_1 &= {0.98\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_2 &= {0.29\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_2 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_3 &= {0.79\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_3 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_4 &= {0.80\\rm\\ m} \\end{aligned} $$ Cargo Ships This topic is in L22-Notes, slides 3-4.

There is no derivation for Newton's equations, because they are an assumed model for dynamics. We can only verify them by comparing with experimental evidence, which confirms that Newtonian dynamics are accurate for non-relativistic and non-quantum systems. Newton's First Law A particle at rest stays that way unless acted on by unbalanced forces. Newton's Second Law Newton's second law: $$ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} $$ Newton's Third Law The mutual forces of action and reaction between two particles are equal, opposite, and collinear. Example animate reset A point mass moving in the plane with an applied force. You can try to made the mass move in a circle and then see what happens when the force is suddenly removed, which will demonstrate Newton's first law (no net force implies motion at constant speed in a constant direction). Also observe which force directions cause the speed to increase or decrease. Click and drag to impart a force on the particle. Idealizations Particles In this course, we assume two things about particles: The mass of the particle is not 0. The radius of the mass is 0. Through these assumptions, we are essentially concentrating all of the mass of an object at a single point in space. The particle has a mass but the size and shape of the particle is not taken into account. Rigid Bodies For rigid bodies, we assume that the object has both mass (similar to particles) but also take its shape into account. We call these bodies \"rigid\" because we assume that they do not deform under applied forces or moments. A rigid body is an extended area of material that includes all the points inside it, and which moves so that the distances and angles between all its points remain constant. The location of a rigid body can be described by the position of one point \\(P\\) inside it, together with the rotation angle of the body (one angle in 2D, three angles in 3D). location description velocity description point mass position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) velocity vector \\( \\vec{ v}_P \\) rigid body in 2D position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) angle \\( \\theta \\) velocity vector \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) rigid body in 3D position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) angles \\( \\theta,\\phi,\\psi \\) velocity vector \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) angular velocity vector \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) Neither point masses nor rigid bodies can physically exist, as no body can really be a single point with no extent, and no extended body can be exactly rigid.

Cartesian coordinate system, showing the origin \\(O\\) and three positions with their coordinates. Notation note When writing coordinates we can either list the coordinate values explicitly, like \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 1\\), or we can just write the numbers in an ordered list, like \\( (2, 1) \\). Writing them as a list assumes that we know which coordinate system we are using, and which order the coordinates are in. We will typically write the coordinate values explicitly to avoid confusion. This also applies to vector components. Vector Bases To describe vectors mathematically, we write them as a combination of basis vectors. An orthonormal basis is a set of two (in 2D) or three (in 3D) basis vectors which are orthogonal (have 90\u00c2\u00b0 angles between them) and normal (have length equal to one). We will not be using non-orthogonal or non-normal bases. Any other vector can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors: Components of a vector. #rvv-ec $$ \\vec{a} = a_1 \\,\\hat{\\imath}+ a_2 \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + a_3 \\,\\hat{k} $$ The numbers \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\) are called the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) in the \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\hat{\\jmath}, \\hat{k} \\) basis.

Two standard arrangements of the basis vectors when working in 2D.

Because we often will be using several bases simultaneously, we will generally write the components explicitly in the \\(3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath\\) form.

    "text": "Vectors and Scalars Scalars vs. Vectors Vectors A vector is an arrow with a length and a direction. Just like positions, vectors exist before we measure or describe them. Unlike positions, vectors can mean many different things, such as position vectors, velocities, etc. Vectors are not anchored to particular positions in space, so we can slide a vector around and locate it at any position. animate reset Change: length direction Two vectors, which may or may not be the same vector. Moving a vector around does not change it: it is still the same vector. Notation Some textbooks differentiate between free vectors, which are free to slide around, and bound vectors, which are anchored in space. We will only use free vectors. We will use the over-arrow notation \\( \\vec{a} \\) for vector quantities. Other common notations include bold \\( \\boldsymbol{a} \\) and under-bars \\( \\underline{a} \\). For unit (length one) vectors we will use an over-hat \\( \\hat{a} \\). Scalars While a vector represents magnitude and direction, a scalar is a number that represents a magnitude, but with no directional information. Some examples of scalar quantities can be mass, length, time, speed, or temperature. Vector Operations Scaling Vectors Vectors can be multiplied by a scalar number, which multiplies their length. Vector Addition and Subtraction Vectors can be added or subtracted together, using the parallelogram law of addition or the head-to-tail rule. Unit Vectors A unit vector is any vector with a length of one. We use the special over-hat notation \\( \\hat{a} \\) to indicate when a vector is a unit vector. Any non-zero vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) gives a unit vector \\( \\hat{a} \\) that specifies the direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\). Normalization to unit vector. #rvv-eu $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{a} =\\frac{\\vec{a}}{a}\\end{aligned} $$  If we compute the length of \\( \\hat{a} \\) then we find: $$ \\| \\hat{a} \\| = \\left\\| \\frac{\\vec{a}}{a} \\right\\| = \\frac{\\|\\vec{a}\\|}{a} = \\frac{a}{a} = 1, $$ so \\( \\hat{a} \\) is really a unit vector, and it is in the same direction as \\( \\vec{a} \\) as they differ only by a scalar factor. Any vector can be written as the product of its length and direction: Vector decomposition into length and direction. #rvv-ei $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = a\\hat{a}\\end{aligned} $$  This follows from rearranging #rvv-eu. Three vectors and their decompositions into lengths and directional unit vectors. Vector Magnitude and Direction Vectors can be written as a magnitude (length) multiplied by the unit vector in the same direction as the original vector. $$ \\vec{A} = \\|\\vec{A}\\| \\hat{u_A}\\ $$ The length of a vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is written either \\( \\| \\vec{a} \\| \\) or just plain \\(a\\).

To find the length of a vector in 3D we can use Pythagorus' theorem twice, as shown below. This gives the two right-triangle calculations: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ell^2 &= a_1^2 + a_2^2 \\\\ a^2 &= \\ell^2 + a_3^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Click and drag to rotate. + Warning: Length must be computed in a single basis. #rvv-wl The Pythagorean length formula can only be used if all the components are written in a single orthonormal basis.

Some common integer vector lengths are \\( \\vec{a} = 4\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(a = 5\\)) and \\( \\vec{b} = 12\\hat\\imath + 5\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(b = 13\\)). + Warning: Adding vectors does not add lengths. #rvv-wa If \\( \\vec{c} = \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\), then \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\ne \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\) unless \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) are parallel and in the same direction. It will always be true, however, that \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\le \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\). This fact is known as the triangle inequality, for reasons that should be obvious. The direction of a vector can be written as a unit vector by dividing the vector components by the vector magnitude. Alternatively, the vector components can be determined geometrically via the angles of each component with respect to the Cartesian Axes. Scalar and Vector Products Dot Product The dot product (also called the inner product or scalar product) is defined by Dot product from components. $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 $$ An alternative expression for the dot product can be given in terms of the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them: Dot product from length/angle. #rvv-ed $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}= a b \\cos\\theta $$  We will present a simple 2D proof here. A more complete proof in 3D uses the law of cosines. Start with two vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) with an angle \\( \\theta \\) between them, as shown below. Observe that the angle \\( \\theta \\) between vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) is the difference between the angles \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) from horizontal. If we use the angle sum formula for cosine, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= a b \\cos(\\theta_b - \\theta_a) \\\\ &= a b (\\cos\\theta_b \\cos\\theta_a + \\sin\\theta_b \\sin\\theta_a) \\end{aligned} $$ We now want to express the sine and cosine of \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) in terms of the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\). We re-arrange the expression so that we can use the fact that \\( a_1 = a \\cos\\theta_a \\) and \\( a_2 = a \\sin\\theta_a \\), and similarly for \\( \\vec{b} \\). This gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= (a \\cos\\theta_a) (b \\cos\\theta_b) + (a \\sin\\theta_a) (b \\sin\\theta_b) \\\\ &= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\end{aligned} $$ The fact that we can write the dot product in terms of components as well as in terms of lengths and angle is very helpful for calculating the length and angles of vectors from the component representations. Length and angle from dot product. #rvv-el $$ \\begin{aligned} a &= \\sqrt{\\vec{a} \\cdot\\vec{a}} \\\\ \\cos\\theta &= \\frac{\\vec{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}}{b a}\\end{aligned} $$  The angle between \\( \\vec{a} \\) and itself is $\\theta = 0$, so \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} = a^2 \\cos 0 = a^2 \\), which gives the first equation for the length in terms of the dot product. The second equation is a rearrangement of #rvv-ed. If two vectors have zero dot product \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 \\) then they have an angle of \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\rm\\ rad \\) between them and we say that the vectors are perpendicular, orthogonal, or normal to each other.

Cross products of basis vectors. #rvv-eo $$ \\begin{aligned}\\hat\\imath \\times \\hat\\jmath &= \\hat{k}& \\hat\\jmath \\times \\hat{k} &= \\hat\\imath& \\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\imath &= \\hat\\jmath \\\\\\hat\\jmath \\times \\hat\\imath &= -\\hat{k}& \\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\jmath &= -\\hat\\imath& \\hat\\imath \\times \\hat{k} &= -\\hat\\jmath \\\\\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the basis vectors in terms of themselves gives the components: $$ \\begin{aligned} i_1 &= 1 & i_2 &= 0 & i_3 &= 0 \\\\ j_1 &= 0 & j_2 &= 1 & j_3 &= 0 \\\\ k_1 &= 0 & k_2 &= 0 & k_3 &= 1. \\end{aligned} $$ These values can now be substituted into the definition #rvv-ex.

Instead, if we have more than one cross product, we should always use parentheses to indicate the order. Rather than using components, the cross product can be defined by specifying the length and direction of the resulting vector. The direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\) is orthogonal to both \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), with the direction given by the right-hand rule. The magnitude of the cross product is given by: Cross product length. #rvv-el2 $$ \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\| = a b \\sin\\theta $$  Using Lagrange's identity we can calculate: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\|^2 &= \\|\\vec{a}\\|^2 \\|\\vec{b}\\|^2 - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 - (a b \\cos\\theta)^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 (1 - \\cos^2\\theta) \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 \\sin^2\\theta. \\end{aligned} $$ Taking the square root of this expression gives the desired cross-product length formula. This second form of the cross product definition can also be related to the area of a parallelogram. The area of a parallelogram is the length of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height, which is also the magnitude of the cross product of the side vectors. A useful special case of the cross product occurs when vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane and the other vector is in the orthogonal \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction. In this case the cross product rotates \\( \\vec{a} \\) by \\( 90^\\circ \\) counterclockwise to give the perpendicular vector \\( \\vec{a}^\\perp \\), as follows. Cross product of out-of-plane vector \\( \\hat{k} \\) with 2D vector \\( \\vec{a} = a_1\\,\\hat\\imath + a_2\\,\\hat\\jmath \\). #rvv-e9 $$ \\hat{k} \\times \\vec{a} = \\vec{a}^\\perp $$  Using #rvv-eo we can compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{k} \\times \\vec{a} &= \\hat{k} \\times (a_1\\,\\hat\\imath + a_2\\,\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ & a_1 (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\imath) + a_2 (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= a_1\\,\\hat\\jmath - a_2\\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ &= \\vec{a}^\\perp. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product identities Cross product anti-symmetry. #rvi-ea $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times\\vec{b} = - \\vec{b} \\times\\vec{a}\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the component expression #rvv-ex gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} &= (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= -(a_3 b_2 - a_2 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\imath} - (a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} - (a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= -\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a}. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product self-annihilation. #rvi-ez $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} = 0\\end{aligned} $$  From anti-symmetry #rvi-ea we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= - \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} \\\\ 2 \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= 0 \\\\ \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= 0. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product bi-linearity. #rvi-eb2 $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c})&= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} \\\\(\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}) \\times \\vec{c}&= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} + \\vec{b} \\times \\vec{c} \\\\\\vec{a} \\times (\\beta \\vec{b})&= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})= (\\beta \\vec{a}) \\times \\vec{b}\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the component expression #rvv-ex for the first equation gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}) &= (a_2 (b_3 + c_3) - a_3 (b_2 + c_2)) \\,\\hat{\\imath} \\\\ &\\quad + (a_3 (b_1 + c_1) - a_1 (b_3 + c_3)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &\\quad + (a_1 (b_2 + c_2) - a_2 (b_1 + c_1)) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\Big((a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &\\quad + \\Big((a_2 c_3 - a_3 c_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 c_1 - a_1 c_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 c_2 - a_2 c_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c}. \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ The second equation follows similarly, and for the third equation we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times (\\beta \\vec{b}) &= (a_2 (\\beta b_3) - a_3 (\\beta b_2)) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 (\\beta b_1) - a_1 (\\beta b_3)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 (\\beta b_2) - a_2 (\\beta b_1)) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\beta \\Big( (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}). \\end{aligned} $$ The last part of the third equation can be seen with a similar derivation. Calculating the cross product The cross products of 3D vectors can be calculated by taking the determinant of specific components of the two vectors. It's best to start by writing a 3x3 matrix with the \\( \\hat{\\imath} \\), \\( \\hat{\\jmath} \\), and \\( \\hat{k} \\) vectors in the first row and the two vectors you are taking the cross product of in the next two rows. See the example below of the cross product between \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} \\): Vector Projection The projection and complementary projection are: Projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) onto \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-ep $$ \\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})= (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}= (a \\cos\\theta) \\, \\hat{b} $$ Complementary projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) with respect to \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-em $$ \\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b})&= \\vec{a} -\\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) =\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b} \\\\\\left\\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\right\\|&= a \\sin\\theta\\end{aligned} $$ Adding the projection and the complementary projection of a vector just give the same vector again, as we can see on the figure below. Projection of \\( \\vec{a} \\) onto \\( \\vec{b} \\) and the complementary projection. As we see in the diagram above, the complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference vector: Complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference. #rvv-er $$ \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 $$  Using the definitions of the complementary projection rvv-em and projection rvv-ep, we compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} &= \\Big(\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}\\Big) \\cdot \\vec{b} \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) (\\hat{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}) \\\\ &= a b \\cos\\theta - (a\\cos\\theta) b \\\\ &= 0. \\end{aligned} $$",

Every free-body diagram should have the following: The body represented as a dot if it is a point mass, and the body itself if it is a rigid body. The external forces/moments. The force vector should indicate: relative magnitude, point of application, and the direction. A properly defined coordinate system A free-body diagram should not include the following: Bodies other than the body we are interested in. Forces applied by the body Internal forces depending on the chosen system. For example, a free-body diagram on a truss should not include the forces between individual truss members. Kinematic quantities (velocity and acceleration). Warning! Always assume the direction of forces/moments to be positive according to the appropriate coordinate system. The calculations from Newton/Euler equations will provide you with the correct direction of those forces/moments. Things that should not follow this are: Gravity Tension Friction if the velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\) is provided Warning! If forces/moments are present, always begin with a free-body diagram. Do not write down equations before drawing the FBD as those are often simple kinematic equations, or Newton/Euler equations.

If the bar is pinned at point \\( A \\) , the force \\( F \\) , applied at a distance \\( d \\) from point A, will cause a moment \\( M_A \\) about point A and make the bar rotate clockwise. The only force that produces a rotation about a point is a force perpendicular to the moment arm (in this case, the moment arm is \\( d \\)). Moments as scalars Moments can be written as scalar quantities, where $$ {M_A} = F*d\\ $$ Note that d is the distance from the applied force to the point of interest and that the force F is the force perpendicular to the moment arm. The moment about point A is dependent on how much of the force \\( F \\) is perpendicular to the moment arm \\( d \\) . You can determine the direction of moments using the right hand rule and wrapping your fingers around where the moment is turning. The direction your thumb is pointing is the direction of the moment. Moments are assumed to be positive when they point in the \\( -\\hat{k} \\) direction (clockwise rotation) and negative when they point in the \\( +\\hat{k} \\) direction (counterclockwise rotation).

Note: These forces and moments will have the same external effect on the body, but the internal forces on the rigid body may be different. For example, the four systems below are statically equivalent, which means that the sum of external forces and sum of extrenal moments are the same for both systems. All four of these systems are statically equivalent. It can be helpful to know what are equivalent transformations for both forces and moments. These are described below: Allowable Force Transformations Replacing two forces with their vector sum: Moving a force ALONG its line of action: Allowable Moment Transformations Replacing a force couple with a couple moment: Moving a couple moment to another spot on a rigid body: Concentrated forces Concentrated forces are forces acting at a specific point on a body. A concentrated force applied to a bar at point A. Distributed loads Distributed loads (usually written as \\( w(x) \\)) are forces applied over a length, volume, or area. The SI units for distributed loads are N/m. These loads, written as a function of length \\( x \\) can be simplified into an equivalent force, \\( F_R \\), which results in the same external loading on the rigid body. The magnitude of the equivalent force \\( F_R \\) is the area under the \\( w(x) \\) curve. The location of the resultant force \\( F_R \\) is the location of the centroid of the shape of the force curve. Rectangular loading For a constant distributed load of magnitude c applied to a bar over a length l, the resultant force magnitude is $$ F_R = c*l\\ $$ the resultant force location is at \\( l/2 \\). Example distributed load (top) and its equivalent force system (bottom). Triangular loading For a triangular distributed load (a uniformly varying load), the magnitude of the load is equivalent to the area of the triangle. $$ F_R = 0.5*c*l\\ $$ The location of \\( F_R \\) is 1/3 from the base of the triangle. Example triangular distributed load (top) and its equivalent force system (bottom). Nonuniform distributed loads More complex distributed loads can be reduced to two distributed loads of uniform shape, or the integral of the distributed load function can be taken to obtain the area under \\( w(x) \\), which is \\( F_R \\). $$ F_R = \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) \\,dx \\ $$ The location of \\( F_R \\) on the beam can be found by solving for the moment \\( M_R \\) about a point.

    "text": "Reaction Forces Because of Newton's Third Law we know that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. We can solve for these reaction forces to understand the loading of a structure. Types of Connections Different supports and different connections have different types of reaction forces depending on what they are constraining. For example, a pin connection restricts movement in the x-and y-directions but doesn't restrict rotation. This means that each pin connection has two reaction forces: one in the x-direciton, and one in the y-direction corresponding to the degrees of freedom that are fixed. A roller support only constrains movement in the y-direction, and thus only has one reaction force (oriented in the y-direction). Constraints that produce one unknown reaction force. Constraints that produce multiple unknown reaction forces or moments. System Classifications Redundant Constraints If a body has more supports than it needs to hold it in equilibrium, it is overly constrained. This will result in more unknown reaction forces than equations we can write, and the problem will not be solvable using statics alone. This type of system is a \"statically indeterminate\" system. In a 2D system, we can write three equilibrium equations (forces in the x and y directions and moments about a point), which means we can solve system with up to three unknowns. If a 2D system has 3 or less unknown reaction forces, it is considered determinate. If it has more than three unknown reaction forces, it is considered indeterminate. Determinate system with 3 unknowns (left) and indeterminate system with 4 unknowns (right). Proper and Improper Constraints A system can be properly or improperly constrained under different loading conditions. A system is considered properly constrained when there is one single solution to the problem. If there are multiple solutions to the problem, then the system is considered properly constrained with redundancy. If there is no solution, the system is considered to be improperly constrained for those specific loading conditions. Stability and Instability If a system is stable in statics, it means that it cannot rotate or translate in any direction under any loading conditions. There are three ways we can analyze a 2D system to determine if it is stable or unstable: If there are less than three reaction forces, the system is unstable and considered \"underconstrained\". If all of the reaction forces have lines of action that are parallel to each other, the system is unstable for translation. Nothing is preventing the system from moving perpendicular to those lines. Stable system (left) and unstable system (right). If all of the reaction forces have lines of action that meet in a single point, the system is unstable for rotation at that point.
